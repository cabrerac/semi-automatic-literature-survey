sectors, yet its adoption is often hindered by concerns about data privacy,
security, and the understanding of AI capabilities. This paper synthesizes AI
governance approaches, strategic themes, and enablers and challenges for AI
adoption by reviewing national AI strategies from leading nations. The key
contribution is the development of an EPIC (Education, Partnership,
Infrastructure, Community) framework, which maps AI implementation requirements
to fully realize social impacts and public good from successful and sustained
AI deployment. Through a multi-perspective content analysis of the latest AI
strategy documents, this paper provides a structured comparison of AI
governance strategies across nations. The findings offer valuable insights for
governments, academics, industries, and communities to enable responsible and
trustworthy AI deployments. Future work should focus on incorporating specific
requirements for developing countries and applying the strategies to specific
AI applications, industries, and the public sector.",arxiv,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

  research issues, state-of-the-art, and future directions","Metaverse is an evolving orchestrator of the next-generation Internet
architecture that produces an immersive and self-adapting virtual world in
which humans perform activities similar to those in the real world, such as
playing sports, doing work, and socializing. It is becoming a reality and is
driven by ever-evolving advanced technologies such as extended reality,
artificial intelligence, and blockchain. In this context, Metaverse will play
an essential role in developing smart cities, which becomes more evident in the
post COVID 19 pandemic metropolitan setting. However, the new paradigm imposes
new challenges, such as developing novel privacy and security threats that can
emerge in the digital Metaverse ecosystem. Moreover, it requires the
convergence of several media types with the capability to quickly process
massive amounts of data to keep the residents safe and well-informed, which can
raise issues related to scalability and interoperability. In light of this,
this research study aims to review the literature on the state of the art of
integrating the Metaverse architecture concepts in smart cities. First, this
paper presents the theoretical architecture of Metaverse and discusses
international companies interest in this emerging technology. It also examines
the notion of Metaverse relevant to virtual reality, identifies the prevalent
threats, and determines the importance of communication infrastructure in
information gathering for efficient Metaverse operation. Next, the notion of
blockchain technologies is discussed regarding privacy preservation and how it
can provide tamper-proof content sharing among Metaverse users. Finally, the
application of distributed Metaverse for social good is highlighted.",arxiv,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of
cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated
machine learning algorithms. Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on
government by improving the provision of essential social goods and services
from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and
environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. The
prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most
urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new
and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and
miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts
will occur.
  This guide, written for department and delivery leads in the UK public sector
and adopted by the British Government in its publication, 'Using AI in the
Public Sector,' identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and
proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. It stresses
that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential
harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place
governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical,
fair, and safe AI systems. It also highlights the need for algorithmically
supported outcomes to be interpretable by their users and made understandable
to decision subjects in clear, non-technical, and accessible ways. Finally, it
builds out a vision of human-centred and context-sensitive implementation that
gives a central role to communication, evidence-based reasoning, situational
awareness, and moral justifiability.",arxiv,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

  high-stakes public sector decision-making","Calls for heightened consideration of fairness and accountability in
algorithmically-informed public decisions---like taxation, justice, and child
protection---are now commonplace. How might designers support such human
values? We interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5
OECD countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values
into their work. The results suggest a disconnect between organisational and
institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current
research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine
learning---absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed.
We see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the
tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable
transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed
both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of
public service. We conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future
directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.",arxiv,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

  cardiac arrest survival","Currently every day in the USA 1000 people die of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)
outside of hospitals or ambulances - before emergency medical help arrives - in
the streets, workplaces, schools and homes of our cities, adults and children.
Brain death commences in 3 minutes, and often the ambulance just can't be there
in time. Citizen cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external
defibrillator (AED) use can save precious minutes and lives. Using public
access AED's saves lives in SCA- however AEDs are used in <2% of cardiac
arrests, though could save lives in 80% if available, findable, functioning,
and used. The systems problem to solve is that there is no comprehensive or
real time accessible database of the AED locations, and also it is not known
that they are actually being positioned where they are needed. The iRescU
project is designed to bridge this gap in SCA survival, by substantially
augmenting the AED database. Utilizing a combination of AED crowd sourcing and
geolocation integrated with existing 911 services and SCA events and projected
events based on machine learning data information to help make the nearest AED
accessible and available in the setting of a SCA emergency and to identify the
areas of greatest need for AEDs to be positioned in the community. Helping to
save lives and address preventable death with a social good approach and

10.1109/ICEDEG58167.2023.10122084,keynote - ai for the public sector and the case of legal nlp,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent innovations such as ChatGPT have increased public interest in artificial intelligence (AI). The keynote explained why AI is not just a short-term hype but has a long history of spanning several eras. A recent revolution has been in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This interdisciplinary field of research is also known as computational linguistics. It is usually implemented by specific NLP tasks, ranging from simple processing steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization to Part of Speech (PoS) tagging and topic modeling. A second, more complex set of NLP tasks includes Namend Entity Recognition (NER), information retrieval, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, text similarity, and coreference resolution. Finally, the most challenging NLP tasks are considered Question Answering (QA), text summarization, text simplification, text generation, text translation, and chatbots. NLP has especially great potential in the public sector. For example, a new multilingual legal language model for more than 20 languages, developed for the Swiss Federal Court, offers opportunities to increase accessibility of legal documents for citizens while preserving the digital sovereignty of government institutions. These technical results of the National Research Program (NRP) 77 project “Open Justice versus Privacy” are published on Hugging Face, a platform for sharing openly available machine learning models and datasets. Today, it is mostly private companies that build such Large Language Models (LLM), because it requires a large amount of computational resources and highly skilled engineers. For example, to train the new LLaMA model, Meta AI (Facebook) needed more than $30 million worth of graphical processing units (GPU). In addition, 450 MWh of electricity worth about $90,000 was needed to process the data on these GPUs. Negative for innovation and the environment, Meta AI released the LLaMA model only under a non-commercial license. This means that startups and other companies cannot use the model for their own services. This calls for a discussion about how “open” today's machine learning models should be and what “open” actually means in the age of AI. The keynote presentation therefore included a proposal of 5 elements of such machine learning models that need to be openly available and licensed under an official open license in order to speak of an Open AI Model. This term is used by the United Nations definition of Digital Public Goods. These five elements include 1) model architecture (detailed scientific publications), 2) hyperparameters (built configuration), 3) training data (labeled and unlabeled datasets), 4) model weights and intermediate checkpoints (parameters), and 5) source code to build the model (programming scripts etc.). A truly openly available AI model is BLOOM, an LLM from the BigScience initiative. It was built by more than 1000 researchers from over 70 countries, trained on an infrastructure that would have cost EUR 3 million. BLOOM was released on July 12th, 2022 on Hugging Face and is licensed under the Responsible AI License (RAIL), a new type of AI license that incorporates ethical aspects while preserving the openness of the machine learning elements described.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122084/,2023 Ninth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG),3-5 April 2023,ieeexplore,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

As a result, there is a growing public interest in weed detection and identification during crop growth. This paper describes a UNet++ method with deep supervision for detecting weeds in sugar beet fields trained on the dataset. The UNet++ architecture is an encoder-decoder network that closes the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks through redesigned skip paths. When the feature maps of the encoder and decoder networks are semantically similar, the optimizer will handle the learning task more easily. We evaluate the comparison of UNet, UNet++, and UNet++ with deep supervision architectures on the dataset segmentation task. Experiments show that the mIoU values on UNet, UNet++ and UNet++ with deep supervision are about 90.81%, 92.00% and 92.34%.

It is becoming a reality and is driven by ever-evolving advanced technologies such as extended reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. In this context, Metaverse will play an essential role in developing smart cities, which becomes more evident in the post-COVID-19-pandemic metropolitan setting. However, the new paradigm imposes new challenges, such as developing novel privacy and security threats that can emerge in the digital Metaverse ecosystem. Moreover, it requires the convergence of several media types with the capability to quickly process massive amounts of data to keep the residents safe and well-informed, which can raise issues related to scalability and interoperability. In light of this, this research study aims to review the literature on the state of the art of integrating the Metaverse architecture concepts in smart cities. First, this paper presents the theoretical architecture of Metaverse and discusses international companies’ interest in this emerging technology. It also examines the notion of Metaverse relevant to virtual reality, identifies the prevalent threats, and determines the importance of communication infrastructure in information gathering for efficient Metaverse operation. Next, the notion of blockchain technologies is discussed regarding privacy preservation and how it can provide tamper-proof content sharing among Metaverse users. Finally, the application of distributed Metaverse for social good is highlighted. Most importantly, the paper explores the reflections of this cutting-edge technology on the smart city, talks about the role and impact of the Metaverse in the production of urban policies, and eventually identifies the research gaps and the future research directions in this domain.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373900/,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,Secondquarter 2024,ieeexplore,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

Skilled trade workers contribute to society by building the infrastructure upon which the public depends. In addition, these technical interventions offer an opportunity for workers to benefit from the data they generate via smart hand tools, potentially creating a new empowerment dynamic with employers. Therefore, we consider technologies that support skilled trade workers in performing their work effectively, safely, and with increased levels of autonomy to be considered Public Interest Technologies (PIT). Interdisciplinary research is underway that aligns these approaches with Public Interest Design (PID) principles which informs researchers' desire to explore how emerging technologies - data cooperatives, blockchain, smart contracts, and data dividends - can further smart hand tools' empowerment dynamic.

10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00435,towards a framework for privacy-preserving pedestrian analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"The design of pedestrian-friendly infrastructures plays a crucial role in creating sustainable transportation in urban environments. Analyzing pedestrian behaviour in response to existing infrastructure is pivotal to planning, maintaining, and creating more pedestrian-friendly facilities. Many approaches have been proposed to extract such behaviour by applying deep learning models to video data. Video data, however, includes an broad spectrum of privacy-sensitive information about individuals, such as their location at a given time or who they are with. Most of the existing models use privacy-invasive methodologies to track, detect, and analyse individual or group pedestrian behaviour patterns. As a step towards privacy-preserving pedestrian analysis, this paper introduces a framework to anonymize all pedestrians before analyzing their behaviors. The proposed framework leverages recent developments in 3D wireframe reconstruction and digital in-painting to represent pedestrians with quantitative wireframes by removing their images while preserving pose, shape, and background scene context. To evaluate the proposed framework, a generic metric is introduced for each of privacy and utility. Experimental evaluation on widely-used datasets shows that the proposed framework outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art image filtering approaches by generating best privacy utility trade-off.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10030965/,2023 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV),2-7 Jan. 2023,ieeexplore,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
10.1109/TTS.2024.3377541,a framework for the interpretable modeling of household wealth in rural communities from satellite data,IEEE,Journals,"Data-driven policy development and investment are necessary for aligning policies across administrative levels, targeting interventions, and meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, local-level economic well-being data at timely intervals, critical to informing policy development and ensuring equity of outcomes, are unavailable in many parts of the world. Yet, filling these data gaps with black-box predictive models like neural networks introduces risk and inequity to the decision- making process. In this work, we construct an alternative interpretable model to these black-box models to predict household wealth, a key socioeconomic well-being indicator, at 5-km scale from widely available satellite data. Our interpretable model promotes transparency, the identification of potential drivers of bias and harmful outcomes, and inclusive design for human-ML decision-making. We model household wealth as a low- order function of productive land use that can be interpreted and integrated with domain knowledge by decision-makers. We aggregate remotely sensed land cover change data from 2006–2019 to construct an interpretable linear regression model for household wealth and wealth change in Uganda at a 5-km scale with  $r^{2}\,\,{=}$  72%. Our results demonstrate that there is not a clear performance-interpretability tradeoff in modeling household wealth from satellite imagery at high spatial and temporal resolution.

In this paper, we analyze the social pulse, obtained from viewer activity in an IPTV network-we attempt to validate a framework for determining public opinion and public interest through implicit feedback of IPTV viewers. First, we address the hypothesis that implicit viewer feedback in the form of channel change events, paired with the content metadata, can be used to model viewers' opinion and interest. For this, we design a controlled experiment to collect explicit feedback by rating a set of general-interest news clips. In addition to collecting demographic information, we also survey viewers' opinion, interest, and the probability of channel change during each clip. Furthermore, we extract weighted feature vectors from the closed captions of the video; this data, combined with the reported probability of channel change, is used to build a model that classifies opinion in five categories based on the probability of channel change and content. Next, we build a simplified model that classifies opinion in five categories based on the interest, which shows a linear relationship, but further consideration of content, in this case, provides better accuracy and possibility to analyze anomalous cases. Finally, we discuss and analyze the applications of such models in large systems and the necessary modifications to scale the system and to ensure the adequate performance on massive IPTV event data streams.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8607973/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

This is not to say the digital spread of news is accurate. In fact, it is far from it; fake news in digital media is much more common. It is especially evident in the new pandemic, at a time when people are in need of accurate information about the effects, tracing, and, most importantly, the progress of the vaccine for COVID-19. The purpose of the study was to create a model that would help internet users to separate fake news from real through its identification in several news articles focusing on topics relating to the COVID-19 vaccine. In order to aid in this issue, the researchers intended to use machine learning to create a classification model to identify whether articles in particular news sites, both reliable and unreliable, were considered to be fake news or not. This was done through the analysis of a given dataset and comparing these datasets with another similar dataset created by the researchers and using existing classification algorithms in order to identify which of them would serve the best results. After which, certain metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and the like were employed to evaluate the created model. The results at the end of the study revealed that news articles on both the gathered reliable and unreliable news sites were mostly positive, and that the best classification algorithm to use for the created model is logistic regression with an accuracy of 83.50%, a precision of 82.37%, a recall of S3.50%, a ROC of 95.99%, and an F-Measure of 82.54%.

10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.00249,defensive patches for robust recognition in the physical world,IEEE,Conferences,"To operate in real-world high-stakes environments, deep learning systems have to endure noises that have been con-tinuously thwarting their robustness. Data-end defense, which improves robustness by operations on input data in-stead of modifying models, has attracted intensive attention due to its feasibility in practice. However, previous data-end defenses show low generalization against diverse noises and weak transferability across multiple models. Motivated by the fact that robust recognition depends on both local and global features, we propose a defensive patch generation framework to address these problems by helping mod-els better exploit these features. For the generalization against diverse noises, we inject class-specific identifiable patterns into a confined local patch prior, so that defensive patches could preserve more recognizable features towards specific classes, leading models for better recognition under noises. For the transferability across multiple models, we guide the defensive patches to capture more global fea-ture correlations within a class, so that they could activate model-shared global perceptions and transfer better among models. Our defensive patches show great potentials to im-prove application robustness in practice by simply sticking them around target objects. Extensive experiments show that we outperform others by large margins (improve 20+ % accuracy for both adversarial and corruption robustness on average in the digital and physical world).11Our codes are available at https://github.com/nlsde-safety-team/DefensivePatch.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9878494/,2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),18-24 June 2022,ieeexplore,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

Free-riding attack poses possibilities and opportunities for unfairness and can seriously impair the operation of the FL ecosystem. It motivates our work to explore and characterize the unique features of free-riding attack, which differ from other attacks such as poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary public goods game-based incentive model (Fed-EPG), which makes the first attempt to construct the interaction model among the participants through the evolutionary public goods game. Specifically, we consider both the public good characteristics of cross-silo FL models as well as the bounded rationality and incomplete information of competitors. We first introduce asymmetric environmental feedback to represent reward and punishment strategies in evolutionary game, and then adopt a multi-segment nonlinear control method to dynamically adjust the rewards and punishments among the participants, which achieves the incentive for the participants to cooperate stably during the training process.

Thus, these tools are being deployed in several ways to address societal issues and concerns for “social good”. For instance, AI/ML has applicable use cases for crisis response, economic empowerment, educational demands, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, and security and justice. In this work, we seek to explore the power and capability of AI/ML in understanding citizens’ engagement, which can improve governance and smart city deployment. Specifically, we studied the views expressed by online users about the city of Saskatoon in Canada. The analyzed views have become a value chain that community leaders can use to improve the governance structure of the city. In the study, we extracted 114,390 comments from Reddit (i.e., Saskatoon subreddit posts) between January 1, 2019, and September 20, 2023, to discover topics to highlight citizens’ concerns. We compare the performance of three major topic models, namely, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and BERTopic with a K-means clustering algorithm in the discovery of topics from the collected Reddit comments. The BERTopic with the K-means clustering algorithm achieved the highest coherence score of approximately 0.64 in the extraction of 25 topics from the dataset. Our findings showed that BERTopic can discover coherent and diverse topics compared to LDA and NMF. We found 12 underlying themes by merging related topics.

In recent years, the initiates of open data also led to the willingness of many government, researchers, and organizations to share their data and make them publicly accessible. An example of open big data is transportation data such as public bus performance data. Analyzing these open big data can be for social good. For instance, by analyzing and mining the public bus performance data, the bus service providers could get an insight on the on-time performance or delay in bus services. By taking appropriate actions (e.g., adding more buses, rerouting some buses routes, etc.) could enhance rider experience.

                  The present study developed several machine learning-based cost models to predict an efficient total economic cost per vehicle revenue-mile of urban public bus transport. The models were trained on a built-in dataset from 269 transit agencies providing urban services in the United States from 2015 to 2019. A feature selection strategy was implemented, finding that, for each proposed model, a subset of features determined a large impact on unit cost. These “core” features included commercial speed, average salary expenses per employee, vehicle productivity, and fleet ownership cost per vehicle. Machine learning techniques outperformed the linear regression method in terms of predictive power and robustness (understood as the dispersion of predictive power measures over the training sets). Based on SHAP values, the sensitivity analyses showed that the proposed models could be used to predict the impact of changes in some critical features on corresponding unit costs. The results may be useful for: (i) introducing regulatory constraints to the allocation of national public resources to local public bus transport services, aimed at minimizing the resources needed to provide a given level of service; (ii) defining the maximum economic compensation required by firms involved in competitive tendering for the allotment of service concessions, or firms with monopoly rights (by political choice and/or local public ownership); and (iii) improving service contract management and design by identifying key cost drivers of transit services.

                  In the context of local residents’ travel activities, access to transportation facilities is crucial and a key factor in achieving the goals of a 15-min city. However, current research on accessibility and land prices seldom fully considers the exploration of the relationship between the two using machine learning models. In this study, we conduct an analysis based on land price and accessibility in Beijing. Firstly, factors such as accessibility, population density, land use types, the number of Points of Interest (POI), and housing prices are selected as independent variables for the model, with land price as the dependent variable. Secondly, the CatBoost model is employed to investigate the complex relationship between accessibility to transit and land prices. Finally, the study introduces the XGBoost model and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method for comparison, validating the effectiveness of the CatBoost model in studying the complex relationship between accessibility and land prices through the comparison of model performance evaluation metrics. A clear nonlinear relationship exists between public transportation accessibility and land prices. Accessibility to bus within a 15-min bicycle is positively associated with land price; its trend shows a sharp increase followed by a gradual increase, and then another sharp increase. Accessibility to metro within the multistage distance threshold walk has a roughly positive association with land price within a certain range. While accessibility to bus within a 15-min walk and accessibility to bus within the multistage distance threshold walk have a negative association with land price. The nonlinear patterns between the four accessibility variables and land prices differ and exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity. Both housing prices and population density positively correlate with land prices. Housing prices sharply increase, then gradually, while population density gradually rises, then sharply. This paper explores the relationship between the two, reinforcing research on the mutual influence of public transportation facilities and surrounding environmental elements. It provides a theoretical basis for promoting transit-oriented development (TOD) and city planning.

Developing a reliable and responsible traffic crash prediction model is crucial to address growing public safety concerns and improve the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of high-risk crashes and the predominance of non-crash characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of crashes, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of crash risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the S patio t emporal Z ero- I nflated T wee d ie G raph N eural N etworks (STZITD-GNN), the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in road-level daily-basis traffic crash prediction for multi-steps. Our model combines the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family with the predictive power of graph neural networks, excelling in predicting a comprehensive range of crash risks. The decoder employs a compound Tweedie model, handling the non-Gaussian distribution inherent in crash data, with a zero-inflated component for accurately identifying non-crash cases and low-risk roads. The model accurately predicts and differentiates between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk scenarios, providing a holistic view of road safety that accounts for the full spectrum of probability and severity of crashes. Empirical tests using real-world traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITD-GNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks, including a reduction in regression error of up to 34.60% in point estimation metrics and an improvement of above 47% in interval-based uncertainty metrics."

                  The global environmental changes have led to frequent occurrences of extreme rainfall, causing urban waterlogging. It is essential to quickly and accurately identify flooding as well as the depth levels. Therefore, Convolutional block attention module (CBAM)-improved ResNet50 is proposed for training to obtain flood depth levels (FDLs) recognition AI models. In this model, CBAM helps the model focus on important features for classifying FDLs, improving accuracy. It also streamlines the fully connected layers, reducing parameters, cutting computational costs, and preventing overfitting. A total of 6294 images related to urban waterlogging were collected for deep learning. The CBAM-improved ResNet50 algorithm achieved the highest test set accuracy at 92.45%, outperforming other algorithms including AlexNet (62.25%), MobileNet-V2 (64.67%), GoogleNet (75.5%), and ResNet50 (79.2%). It also demonstrates good predictive performance and generalization capabilities for urban waterlogging situations against various backgrounds. The computer vision recognition of the FDLs was explained through Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping in visualized images. Finally, through the established WeChat mini-program and AI model, the public can access the current FDLs at any time and place. This study provides information on the FDLs, offering a comprehensive overview of the severity of floods in the early stages of emergency response.

                  Social media platforms have become a popular source of information for real-time monitoring of events and user behavior. In particular, Twitter provides invaluable information related to diseases and public health to build real-time disease surveillance systems. Effective use of such social media platforms for public health surveillance requires data-driven AI models which are hindered by the difficult, expensive, and time-consuming task of collecting high-quality and large-scale datasets. In this paper, we build and analyze the Epidemic TweetBank (EpiBank) dataset containing 271 million English tweets related to six epidemic-prone diseases COVID19, Flu, Hepatitis, Dengue, Malaria, and HIV/AIDs. For this purpose, we develop a tool of ESS-T (Epidemic Surveillance Study via Twitter) which collects tweets according to provided input parameters and keywords. Also, our tool assigns location to tweets with 95% accuracy value and performs analysis of collected tweets focusing on temporal distribution, spatial patterns, users, entities, sentiment, and misinformation. Leveraging ESS-T, we build two geo-tagged datasets of EpiBank-global and EpiBank-Pak containing 86 million tweets from 190 countries and 2.6 million tweets from Pakistan, respectively. Our spatial analysis of EpiBank-global for COVID19, Malaria, and Dengue indicates that our framework correctly identifies high-risk epidemic-prone countries according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics.

                  The urban heat island effect is a prevalent urban concern, and studies on its influencing factors are essential to mitigate its negative effects and promote sustainable urban development. Although many studies have revealed the impact of land cover change on land surface temperature (LST) during urbanization, most have focused only on built-up areas without considering the relationship between urban internal functional structure and LST. To clarify the influence of changes in urban functional zones (UFZs) on LST, focusing on the downtown area of Nanjing City, China, this study proposed an effective framework using multi-source geospatial data for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Specifically, very high spatial resolution images and point of interest data were jointly used to generate UFZ maps using an advanced deep learning approach, and LST distribution maps were retrieved from Landsat 8 images using the radiative transfer equation. The UFZ and LST maps were then overlaid and analyzed to reveal the impact of UFZ change on LST. The results showed that in 2013, 2018, and 2022, the residential region constituted the largest proportion of area, comprising 23.52%, 24.52%, and 27.28%, respectively. The areas of unused region and transport region experienced the most rapid decrease and increase of 6.08% and 4.05% from 2013 to 2022, respectively. Furthermore, the area of sub-high temperature zone decreased the most, by 3.47%, whereas that of the high-temperature zone increased the most, by 6.05%. In the study area, water and green space maintained relatively low LSTs, whereas residential region and unused region exhibited higher LSTs. From 2013 to 2022, UFZ changes contributed to a 0.71°C increase in LST. Transfers from green space, water, commercial region, transport region, and industrial region mostly resulted in a higher LST, which was associated with a decrease in fractional vegetation cover (FVC). Transfers from unused region, residential region, and public service region mostly contributed to reducing LST, which was caused by the increase in FVC. The findings and the proposed framework can provide reliable references for urban managers to optimize urban spatial layout and promote sustainable urban development.

                  The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. In this study, we carried out wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in three key port cities in China through real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR). Next, a novel machine learning algorithm (MLA) based on Gaussian model and random forest model was used to predict the epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. The results showed that from February 2023 to January 2024, three port cities experienced two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which peaked in late-May and late-August 2023, respectively. Two waves of IAV were observed in the spring and winter of 2023, respectively with considerable variations in terms of onset/offset date and duration. Furthermore, we employed MLA to extract the key features of epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV from February 3rd, to October 15th, 2023, and thereby predicted the epidemic trends of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV from October 16th, 2023 to April 22nd, 2024, which showed high consistency with the observed values. These collective findings offer an important understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV epidemics, suggesting that wastewater surveillance together with MLA emerges as a powerful tool for risk assessment of respiratory viral diseases and improving public health preparedness.

                  In a context of high pressure on national asylum systems and a strive for efficiency, public authorities in Europe are increasingly exploring the potential of artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the asylum process. The use of this technology in the field of asylum is a growing but contentious topic, which raises important normative questions and concerns. In this context, this paper aims to analyse the potential implications for fair asylum procedures when artificial intelligence (AI) assists decision-making. Fair asylum procedures, or due process, are a central condition for guaranteeing the right to asylum and preventing unlawful refoulement, and overall ensuring trust in the asylum adjudication system. After revisiting the theoretical foundations of the concept of fair procedures, this paper develops a normative framework that can guide further reflection on the use of AI in asylum procedures. It thereby analyses the concepts that are key to the debate on the use of AI in decision-making: accuracy, efficiency but also participation. Then, drawing on scholarship in both political science and computer science, it explores potential challenges for the core values of fair procedures, considering both technical and non-technical challenges. This paper concludes that while AI promises efficiency gains for the administration, it identifies important challenges for accuracy and participation. On the basis of these considerations, it highlights the questions that should be asked and answered in order to protect the core values of fair asylum procedures.

                  Urban parks, as important carrier of outdoor physical activity, can effectively reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and promote public health. The accessibility of parks directly affects residents’ levels of physical activity. However, current accessibility assessments do not consider physical activity needs into account and are unable to adapt to the current developmental needs of a healthy China. We propose a framework for evaluating park accessibility oriented towards a physical activity service perspective. First, we introduced a park attractiveness index based on physical activity preferences. The index encompasses not only objective park features but also subjective environmental perception features, which are evaluated using deep-learning techniques. Furthermore, the size of the park catchment area was correlated with the park attractiveness index, and the likelihood of park selection based on people's physical activity preferences was computed. Fuzhou City's Gulou District was selected for this case study. The results show the following: (1) Our proposed evaluation model can identify more underserved neighborhoods in scenarios geared toward physical activity requirements than traditional approaches. (2) The distribution of parks in the Gulou District was not sufficiently balanced, with the accessibility value at the 90th percentile only slightly higher than the average value of 6.35. There was obvious spatial differentiation, with a pattern of high values in the central area and low values in the surrounding areas. (3) Approximately 12.70 % of the population is located within service-blind zones and the overall level of accessibility is poor. This study offers novel ideas and approaches for optimizing the spatial layout of urban parks within a health-oriented framework. This aids planners and policymakers in enhancing the spatial layout of parks and ensuring equitable access to urban parks that foster physical activity.

                  Respiratory health is negatively influenced by the dimensions and constituents of particulate matter (PM). Although mass concentration is widely acknowledged to be key to assessing dust retention by urban trees, the role of plant leaves in filtering PM from the urban atmosphere, particularly regarding the particle dimensions and chemical constituents of retained PM on the leaf, remains elusive. Here we combined single-particle aerosol mass spectrometry and a particle resuspension chamber to investigate how urban tree species capture PM constituents. Results indicate that leaves are efficient in capturing relatively larger particles (1.0–2.0 μm). Compositionally, airborne particles were mostly composed of elemental carbon (EC, 20%), organic carbon (OC, 17%), and secondary reaction products (13%). However, leaf surfaces revealed a preference for retaining crustal species, comprising 55% of captured particulates. Notably, specific tree species demonstrated varied affinities for different PM constituents: Osmanthus fragrans Lour. predominantly captured levoglucosan (LEV), indicative of its efficiency against biomass burning particles, whereas Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J.Presl and Sabina chinensis var. kaizuca W.C.Cheng & W.T.Wang were more effective in capturing heavy metals (HMs). XGBoost modelling identified indicator ions, e.g., CN−, NO3
                     −, NO2
                     −, PO3
                     −, with SHAP values surpassing 0.035, suggesting a preferential adsorption of these ions among different tree species. These findings demonstrate that the particulate capture efficiency of urban tree species varies with species-specific leaf properties, particularly in their ability to selectively adsorb particles containing hazardous constituents such as LEV and HMs. This study provides a scientific basis for the strategic selection of tree species in urban forestry initiatives aimed at improving air quality and public health.

                  The development of artificial intelligence (AI) humanoid bots/robots (AIHB/R), which integrate AI with robot technology to emulate human traits, has swiftly evolved and found applications in several sectors like healthcare, education, home support, industrial production, and entertainment. AIHB/R's decision-making process has become more complex due to incorporating AI, a fascinating element affecting public perceptions and attitudes towards these robots. This paper investigates this topic in the Turkish context based on data collected from 485 adults. A general finding is that participants have positive perceptions and attitudes towards (AIHB/R) and some concerns. We found significant gender differences between male and female participants regarding the use of AIHB/R in care and treatment services (CTS), administration and justice (AJ), and in the future (FC). No gender difference was found when using religious practice (RP). The educational level statistically correlated significantly with the total scale scores and the four sub-domains. CTS has a positive and moderately significant effect on accepting AIHB/R applications. The R2 value for this domain showed the highest explanatory power of the model with 0.829.

Current research, however, often overlooks non-economic dimensions of urban values, resulting in biased socioeconomic outcomes and neglected socio-spatial heterogeneity for sustainable urban planning. This study employs spatially explicit machine learning (ML) approaches to comprehensively investigate the characterisation of urban value uplift and its predictors. Applying GWPCA to the municipality of Shanghai, the results reveal significant heterogeneity in urban value uplift characterisation. While the municipality shows a generally homogeneous polycentric growth pattern, central areas exhibit economic growth, and peripheral areas are enhanced with place value. Additionally, combining a Spatially Enhanced CatBoost algorithm (CTB-S) and SHAPley value, analysis on uplift predictors indicates that urban policy, among many other features, tends to catalyse further economic uplift specifically in central areas. Our findings underscore the inherent heterogeneity in urban change process, necessitating spatially tailored approaches for policymakers to capture urban value uplifts. By addressing the unique needs of different urban areas, policymakers can promote sustainable urban environments that ensure equitable economic and social benefits across all communities."

                  This study evaluates the potential radiological effects resulting from the use of a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), commonly known as a “dirty bomb,” in Dhamar City, Yemen, focusing on its impact on human health. Seasonal atmospheric variations were analyzed using the HotSpot Health Physics Code to model the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) distribution following an explosion. The TEDE’s effect on different human organs was assessed, considering both external and internal radiation exposures. The study demonstrated that winter nights posed the highest radiation risk, with dose distribution areas of 0.018 km2, 0.14 km2, and 3.3 km2 for inner, middle, and outer zones, respectively, surpassing other seasonal and daily values. Conversely, summer recorded the lowest radiation spread. A detailed temporal analysis during winter nights showed an initial TEDE of 9.5 Sv at 0.1 min post-explosion, which decreased exponentially to 1.3 Sv after 2000 min (33.3 h) and further to 0.0038 Sv after 6500 min (108.3 h) with the aid of AI-enhanced “Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)”. The highest radiation doses to human organs within a 100 m2 area during the initial 10 min post-detonation were significantly above permissible limits, with critical organs like the surface bone, liver, and red marrow receiving doses of 68 Sv, 12 Sv, and 5.5 Sv, respectively. These findings underline the need for robust emergency response strategies and long-term health monitoring to mitigate the adverse health impacts of RDDs. The comprehensive assessment presented in this study, enhanced by artificial intelligence, provides essential data for improving public health safety and emergency preparedness in regions susceptible to radiological threats.

The findings obtained from the review of related research suggest that simulation models have been widely used in the healthcare sector as valuable tools to aid decision-making aimed at the improvement of healthcare process management. However, the analyzed works lack sufficient evidence regarding the utilization of systematic approaches in the development of their proposals. We have conducted a research effort in this field, resulting in the design of a conceptual framework that guides in the systematic development of decision support systems centered around simulation models. The framework includes a specific methodology for developing simulation models, with simulation modeling experimentation serving as a valuable technique for assessing the impact of potential changes on the performance of the process. To illustrate the applicability and practical value of the proposed framework, we have developed an application case within the context of the Urgent Healthcare for Women's (UHW) process in a public hospital in Andalusia, Spain."

                  The transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs) for reducing urban greenhouse gas emissions is hindered by the lack of public charging infrastructure, particularly fast-charging stations. Given that electric vehicle fast charging stations (EVFCS) can burden the electricity grid, it is crucial for EVFCS to adopt sustainable energy supply methods while accommodating the growing demands of EVs. Despite recent research efforts to optimize the placement of renewable-powered EV charging stations, current planning methods face challenges when applied to a complex city scale and integrating with renewable energy resources. This study thus introduces a robust decision-making model for optimal EVFCS placement planning integrated with solar power supply in a large and complex urban environment (e.g., Chicago), utilizing an advantage actor-critic (A2C) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The model balances traffic demand with energy supply, strategically placing charging stations in areas with high traffic density and solar potential. As a result, the model is used to optimally place 1,000 charging stations with a random starting search approach, achieving total reward values of 74.30 %, and estimated the capacities of potential EVFCS. This study can inform the identification of suitable locations to advance the microgrid-based charging infrastructure systems in large urban environments.

This study aimed to design an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and machine learning for the rapid detection of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) resistance in KP to improve clinical decision-making processes. Methods Out of 107,721 bacterial samples, 675 specimens of KP with suspected multi-drug resistance were selected. These specimens were collected from a tertiary hospital and four secondary hospitals between 2022 and 2023 to evaluate CZA resistance. We used MALDI-TOF MS and machine learning to develop an AI-CDSS with enhanced speed of resistance detection. Results Machine learning models, especially light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95, indicating high accuracy. The predictive models formed the core of our newly developed AI-CDSS, enabling clinical decisions quicker than traditional methods using culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing by a day. Conclusions The study confirms that MALDI-TOF MS, integrated with machine learning, can swiftly detect CZA resistance. Incorporating this insight into an AI-CDSS could transform clinical workflows, giving healthcare professionals immediate, crucial insights for shaping treatment plans. This approach promises to be a template for future anti-resistance strategies, emphasizing the vital importance of advanced diagnostics in enhancing public health outcomes."

No study has analyzed online discussions about GLP-1RAs. Objectives The purpose of this study was to analyze perceptions of GLP-1RAs on social media. Methods We analyzed GLP-1RA-related posts on Reddit between May 28, 2013, and June 1, 2023. All posts were identified that included generic or brand names of GLP-1RAs. Post volume on Reddit was compared to search interest on Google over time. An artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline consisting of a semi-supervised natural language processing model (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]), a dimensionality reduction technique, and a clustering algorithm was used to cluster posts into related topics. Discussion sentiment was classified using a pretrained BERT model and assessed qualitatively. Results 14,390 GLP-1RA-related Reddit posts by 8,412 authors were identified. Ninety-four percent of posts were created after 2021, consistent with search interest trend on Google. We used the AI model to categorize posts into 30 topics which were hierarchically grouped by the model based on shared content. Posts were identified among communities for individuals with diabetes and obesity, as well as for diseases without a Food and Drug Administration-approved indication. Most posts had a negative sentiment using the pretrained model, acknowledging the pretrained model is at risk for misclassifying posts. Conclusions AI can generate insights on perceptions of GLP-1RAs on social media. Common themes included success stories of improving diabetes and obesity management, struggles with insurance coverage, and questions regarding diet, side effects, and medication administration."

                  Rapid urbanization and industrialization have intensified air pollution, posing severe health risks and necessitating accurate PM2.5 predictions for effective urban air quality management. This study distinguishes itself by utilizing high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data for a grid-based spatial analysis of Istanbul, Türkiye, a densely populated city with diverse pollutant sources. It assesses the predictive accuracy of advanced machine learning (ML) models—Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), Random Forest (RF), and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX). Notably, it introduces genetic algorithm optimization for the NARX model to enhance its performance. The models were trained on hourly PM2.5 concentrations from twenty monitoring stations across 2020–2021. Istanbul was divided into seven regions based on ERA5 grid distributions to examine PM2.5 spatial variability. Seventeen input variables from ERA5, including meteorological, land cover, and vegetation parameters, were analyzed using the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) method to identify the most predictive variables. Comparative analysis showed that while all models provided valuable insights (RF > LGB > XGB > MLR), the NARX model outperformed them, particularly with the complex dataset used. The NARX model achieved a high R-value (0.89), low RMSE (5.24 μg/m³), and low MAE (2.94 μg/m³). It performed best in autumn and winter, with the highest accuracy in Region-1 (R-value 0.94) and the lowest in Region-5 (R-value 0.75). This study's success in a complex urban setting with limited monitoring underscores the robustness of the NARX model and the methodology's potential for global application in similar urban contexts. By addressing temporal and spatial variability in air quality predictions, this research sets a new benchmark and highlights the importance of advanced data analysis techniques for developing targeted pollution control strategies and public health policies.

Adoption of sustainable E-waste management strategies has become crucial to address the growing effects of e-waste on the environment and human health. This in-depth overview of existing practices, problems, and new technology developments in sustainable E-waste disposal is presented in this thorough review article. The article analyses the efficiency of frequently used E-waste management strategies for reducing environmental effects and fostering resource recovery, including recycling, refurbishing, landfilling, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) initiatives. The main difficulties that policymakers, producers, recyclers, consumers, and employees in the unorganized sector of the economy confront in managing e-waste are also discussed, along with possible solutions. The analysis emphasizes the value of ecologically sound E-waste recycling techniques and examines new technology advancements, such as automated disassembly and trash sorting based on artificial intelligence, aimed at improving recycling efficiency and lowering environmental burdens. Along with successful case studies, the idea of a circular economy and sustainable product design in E-waste management are also covered. It is highlighted the need of strong legislative frameworks, international partnerships, and public engagement in responsible E-waste disposal in order to address the issue of transboundary flows of E-waste. In its last section, the paper sketches out the picture for the future and makes suggestions for how governments, businesses, and other stakeholders may adopt sustainable E-waste management approaches and further the development of a circular economy for E-waste."

(plane trees) are common ornamental tree in Poland that produces a large amount of wind-transported pollen, which contains proteins that induce allergy symptoms. Allergy sufferers can limit their contact with pollen by avoiding places with high pollen concentrations, which are restricted mainly to areas close to plane trees. Their location is thus important, but creating a detailed street tree inventory is expensive and time-consuming. However, high-resolution remote sensing data provide an opportunity to detect the location of specific plants. But acquiring high-resolution spatial data of good quality also incurs costs and requires regular updates. Therefore, this study explored the potential of using open access remote sensing data to detect plane trees in the highly urbanized environment of Poznań (western Poland). Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was used to detect training treetops, which were subsequently marked as young plane trees, mature plane trees, other trees or artefacts. Spectral and spatial variables were extracted from circular buffers (r = 1 m) around the treetops to minimize the influence of shadows and crown overlap. A random forest machine learning algorithm was applied to assess the importance of variables and classify the treetops within a radius of 6.2 km around the functioning pollen monitoring station. The model performed well during 10-fold cross-validation (overall accuracy ≈ 92%). The predicted Platanus sp. pl. locations, aggregated according to 16 wind directions, were significantly correlated with the hourly pollen concentrations. Based on the correlation values, we established a threshold of prediction confidence, which allowed us to reduce the fraction of false-positive predictions. We proposed the spatially continuous index of airborne pollen exposure probability, which can be useful for allergy sufferers. The results showed that open-access geodata in Poland can be applied to recognize major local sources of plane pollen."

                  Using an embedded mixed method design, we compared a nationally representative sample of US adults and a sample of US-based emergency managers (EM) on their attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and their intentions to rely on AI in a set of decision-making scenarios relevant to emergency management. Emergency managers reported significantly less positive attitudes toward AI and were less likely to rely on AI for decisions compared to the nationally representative sample. Our analysis of EMs' open-ended responses explaining their choices to use or not use AI-based solutions reflected specific concerns about implementation rather than wariness toward AI generally. These concerns included the complexity of the potential outcomes in the scenarios, the value they placed on human input and their own extensive experience, procedural concerns, collaborative decision-making, team-building, training, and the ethical implications of decisions, rather than a rejection of AI more generally. Managers' insights integrated with our quantitative findings led to a person-environment fit framework for AI implementation in the public sector. Our findings and framework have implications for how AI systems should be introduced and integrated in emergency managerial contexts and in public sector organizations more generally. Public managers' perceptions and intentions to use AI and organizational oversight processes are at least as important as technology design considerations when public sector organizations are considering the deployment of AI.

In this paper, we argue that understanding the process of generating such knowledge is essential to strategically develop ML. In efforts to contribute to such understanding, we examine the generation of new knowledge from domain knowledge through ML via an exploratory study of two cases in the Swedish public sector. The findings reveal the roles of three mechanisms – dubbed consolidation, algorithmic mediation, and naturalization – in tying domain knowledge to machine knowledge.

                  The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the integration of social robots within the healthcare sector. This research employs a tripartite methodology, combining Google Trends analysis, bibliometric analysis, and a systematic literature review, to gauge both public and research interest in social robots within the healthcare domain. In the Google Trends analysis, search query data for “Social Robots” was retrieved, encompassing both “all categories” and the specific “health” category. Seasonal effects on relative search volumes (RSV) were assessed through the cosinor model. The analysis confirmed statistically significant seasonal patterns in RSV for “social robots” within the “health” category. Conversely, for the broader “all categories,” only the intercept showed significance, while sinw and cosw were deemed insignificant. For bibliometric analysis, the global literature on “robotics” and “healthcare” was examined in the SCOPUS database. From the extensive pool of publications, 144 relevant studies were identified out of 4037 publications. These studies were further analyzed using VOSviewer, providing insights into recent trends and hot topics concerning social robots in healthcare. The systematic literature review focused on 46 articles published from 2019 to the end of 2023. The findings revealed a lack of consensus on the drivers, barriers, and outcomes associated with social robot acceptance and human-robot interaction (HRI). The study systematically maps the existing research on these aspects, introducing a novel categorization and presenting the concept of a “robot user's ecosystem.” This concept emphasizes the imperative involvement of all stakeholders in the development and understanding of social robots. Ultimately, this methodological approach not only identifies nine research gaps in the current literature but also formulates numerous research questions to guide future researchers in this domain.

Thus, a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving the trust judgment call is essential to avoid unwarranted trust. In this commentary paper, we propose that addressing the notion of trust in consumer-facing LLM-based systems across the insurance industry can confer enhanced specificity to this debate. The concept and role of trust are germane to this particular setting due to the highly intangible nature of the product coupled with elevated levels of risk, complexity, and information asymmetry. Moreover, widespread use of LLMs in this sector is to be expected, given the vast array of text documents, particularly general policy conditions or claims protocols. Insurance as a practice is highly relevant to the welfare of citizens and has numerous spillover effects on wider public policy areas. We therefore argue that a domain-specific approach to good AI governance is essential to avoid negative externalities around financial inclusion. Indeed, as a constitutive element of trust, vulnerability is particularly challenging within this high-stakes set of transactions, with the adoption of LLMs adding to the socio-ethical risks. In light of this, our commentary provides a valuable baseline to support regulators and policymakers in unravelling the profound socioeconomic consequences that may arise from adopting consumer-facing LLMs in insurance."

                  Public transportation usage prediction is valuable for the sustainable development of transportation systems, particularly in crowded megacities. Machine learning technologies are of great interest for predicting public transportation usage. While these technologies outperform many other techniques, they suffer from limited interpretability. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools and techniques that offer post-hoc explanations of the obtained predictions are gaining popularity. This paper proposes an advanced tree-based ensemble algorithm for public transportation usage rate prediction. We aim to explain the predictions both with the most widely used technique of XAI, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) and in the light of the rules presented. To predict the total public transportation usage, the proposed model combines all types of public transportation, categorized as ferry, railway, and bus, unlike most existing studies focusing on a single kind of public transport. Besides the sort of transportation, the day of the week, whether the day is special, and the daily ratio of passenger types were identified as model features for predicting the daily usage of each type of public transportation. We tested the proposed model using an open data set from Izmir City, Turkey. While the model had superior prediction performance, the explanations showed that the type of public transportation, weekday, and the ratio of full-fare passengers have the highest SHAP values, and the model features have many interactions. We also validated our results using an online data set showing Google search trends.

                  Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a complex mixture of aerosol particles with varying properties and sources, both local and distant. In areas lacking detailed monitoring of PM2.5 speciation, the common source-apportionment analyses are not applicable. This study demonstrates an alternative framework for estimating sources and processes that affect observed PM2.5 concentrations when information on the particle composition is unavailable. Eight years (2012–2019) of half-hourly PM2.5 observations from 10 air quality monitoring (AQM) stations, clustered according to their airmass transport sector were analyzed, using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Factors were determined based on their variation in time, space, and between airmass sectors. Employing a supervised machine-learning model provided insights into the relationships between the extracted factors, meteorological parameters and co-measured airborne pollutants. Factor interpretations were evaluated through comparisons with measurements of PM2.5 species from a nearby Surface PARTiculate mAtter Network (SPARTAN) station. The NMF successfully separated background factors from an urban anthropogenic-activity factor, with the latter accounting for approximately 60 % of the observed PM2.5 levels in Tel Aviv (∼

                     ). Positive monotonic relationships were observed between the PM2.5 urban anthropogenic-activity factor and measurements of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and absolute humidity (AH), representing the impact of traffic emissions and hygroscopic growth, respectively. The summer background factor was found to represent long-range transport (LRT) from Europe, showing a good agreement (R2 = 0.81) with ammonium sulphate concentrations. Our results demonstrate that a spatial NMF analysis can reliably estimate contributions of different sources with distinct compositions and properties to the total observed PM2.5. Using such an analysis, future environmental health studies could assess health risks associated with exposure to distinct PM2.5 fractions. This information may assist decision makers to set environmental targets for abating PM2.5 with specific compositions and properties.

It is anticipated that the intensity, duration, and frequency of these extremes will escalate in the future. This study aims to discover the association between temperature extremes and agricultural yield and to project these extremes using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models with CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) data under two SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). A bi-wavelet coherence technique is employed to investigate the association, providing detailed information in both the frequency and time domains for the period of 1980–2014. Various ML and DL models are trained and tested for the periods of 1985–2004 and 2005–2014, respectively, with gradient boosting machine chosen for projecting temperature extremes based on its superior performance. Mann-Kendall test is used for trend analysis in the projected temperature extremes. The results indicate strong negative and positive associations between TN10p (Cold nights) and TN90p (Warm nights), respectively, with wheat production. Additionally, there is a long-term negative association of CSDI (Cold Spell Duration Indicator) and strong positive association of WSDI (Warm Spell Duration Indicator) with rice yield. Projected results show an increase and decrease under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, in DTR (Diurnal Temperature Range) at most stations. TN10p will increase in the future at most stations, with exceptions such as Muree station where it decreases during 2025–2049 and then increases under both SSPs. Projections show that TXn (annual or monthly minimum value of daily maximum temp) will increase in the future, with Muree station exhibiting the lowest value close to zero, while the average maximum value is around 20 °C at Khanpur station. Trend analysis reveals significantly increasing trend in TR20 (Tropical nights) and decreasing trend in CSDI in future durations under both SSPs. These findings hold implications for policymakers and stakeholders in various departments, including agriculture, health, and water resources management."

                  The environmental, social, and economic challenges associated with the massive activities of the oil and gas industry require analysis and evaluation of companies' sustainability priorities. Evaluating the environmental performance of oil companies requires the application of strict mathematical tools and models that provide rigorous results. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is a rigorous tool that evaluates the performance and practices of oil and sustainable energy companies. However, classical multi-criteria decision analysis has problems related to inconsistency because of the subjective nature of pairwise comparisons. This study responded to the literature call by utilizing the weight fuzzy judgment method (WFJM) to determine the weight coefficients of criteria with zero consistency. Such a method employed criteria values and expert judgment for decision-making to create a bridge between the mathematical approach and the human approach. This study aims to develop a solid decision support system by evaluating and benchmarking 11 companies utilizing the fuzzy judgment method based on fuzzy theory and the VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method to determine sustainability priorities for oil and gas companies. The oil companies’ criteria were efficiently weighted by the fuzzy judgment method, and the organizational capabilities represented the greatest weight value of 0.128, whilst the low-weight criteria were the high costs of technologies at 0.080. Besides, the benchmarking results for oil companies revealed that COM 8 was the best, whilst COM 11 was the worst. The fuzzy judgment technique is a unique approach to solving complicated decision-making problems, and its influence can be significant. Furthermore, this method can be applied in sectors other than energy, including banking, medical services, and engineering, where decision-making is not straightforward and requires a systematic approach.

                  Accurate prediction of air pollutant concentrations can be effective in controlling and preventing air pollution, which is crucial for both the government's policy response and the public's reasonable ability to avoid air pollution. In this study, we propose a model based on the principle of big data correlation and deep learning techniques for predicting the concentration of air pollutant concentrations. The proposed model, named STARes-SaLSTM, consists of a residual neural network with spatiotemporal attention (STAResNet) and a temporal self-attention based on long short-term memory network (SaLSTM). The spatiotemporal attention module in STAResNet enhances the original input information by weighting it in both spatial and temporal dimensions, meanwhile the features of the spatial distribution of pollutant and meteorological information across many cities are deeply extracted using ResNet. A novel self-attention method known as temporal self-attention is developed to extract the temporal dependency of air pollutants. LSTM is used as a sequence encoder in this temporal attention method to calculate queries, keys, and values to acquire a more comprehensive temporal dependence than is possible with normal self-attention. The STARes-SaLSTM model successfully predicts air pollution concentrations in the target city for the future by extracting spatiotemporal correlation of feature sequence. In comparison to previous neural network models and conventional methods, the model increases the accuracy of pollutant concentration prediction. The suggested prediction model works well for the one to 3 h prediction job, with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 6.716 to 11.648. Furthermore, even for the 1–24 h prediction assignment, we executed multi-scale prediction in the target city and obtained a reasonable performance, with an average RMSE value of 20.576.

Manually locating cooling towers from aerial imagery during outbreak investigations requires expertise, is labour intensive, and can be prone to errors. We aimed to train a deep learning computer vision model to automatically detect cooling towers that are aerially visible. Methods Between Jan 1 and 31, 2021, we extracted satellite view images of Philadelphia (PN, USA) and New York state (NY, USA) from Google Maps and annotated cooling towers to create training datasets. We augmented training data with synthetic data and model-assisted labelling of additional cities. Using 2051 images containing 7292 cooling towers, we trained a two-stage model using YOLOv5, a model that detects objects in images, and EfficientNet-b5, a model that classifies images. We assessed the primary outcomes of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the model against manual labelling on test datasets of 548 images, including from two cities not seen in training (Boston [MA, USA] and Athens [GA, USA]). We compared the search speed of the model with that of manual searching by four epidemiologists. Findings The model identified visible cooling towers with 95·1% sensitivity (95% CI 94·0–96·1) and a PPV of 90·1% (95% CI 90·0–90·2) in New York City and Philadelphia. In Boston, sensitivity was 91·6% (89·2–93·7) and PPV was 80·8% (80·5–81·2). In Athens, sensitivity was 86·9% (75·8–94·2) and PPV was 85·5% (84·2–86·7). For an area of New York City encompassing 45 blocks (0·26 square miles), the model searched more than 600 times faster (7·6 s; 351 potential cooling towers identified) than did human investigators (mean 83·75 min [SD 29·5]; mean 310·8 cooling towers [42·2]). Interpretation The model could be used to accelerate investigation and source control during outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease through the identification of cooling towers from aerial imagery, potentially preventing additional disease spread. The model has already been used by public health teams for outbreak investigations and to initialise cooling tower registries, which are considered best practice for preventing and responding to outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease.

These changes, coupled with consumer inclination to adopt new dietary trends, may heighten the intake of unfamiliar proteins, or escalate consumption of specific ones, potentially amplifying the prevalence of known and undiscovered food allergies. Assessing the allergenicity of novel or modified protein-based foods encounters several challenges, including uncertainty surrounding acceptable risks and assessment criteria for determining safety. Moreover, the available methodological tools for gathering supportive data exhibit significant gaps. This paper synthesises these challenges, addressing the varied interpretations of ""safe"" across jurisdictions and societal attitudes towards allergenic risk. It proposes a comprehensive two-part framework for allergenicity assessment: the first part emphasises systematic consideration of knowledge and data requirements, while the second part proposes the application of a generic assessment approach, integrating a Threshold of Allergological Concern. This combined framework highlights areas that require attention to bridge knowledge and data gaps, and it delineates research priorities for its development and implementation."

                  As social media platforms grow rapidly, multi-modal data is becoming more and more prevalent. A user can better understand events by analyzing multimodal data for topics. Automatic topic detection from multimodal data can potentially have tremendous value for advertising and government agencies for whom public opinion matters for strategic decisions and policy making. However , multimodal topic detection is complicated for two reasons: (1) The nature of the multimodal data varies from one medium to another, and (2) The noisy nature of webdata. Conventional topic models are ineffective in dealing with these two problems. This paper proposes, a framework for multimodal topic modeling for social media data that uses topics extracted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and patterns found from images using transfer learning. The proposed framework makes use of textual as well as visual data for topic detection. The experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MCG WEBV. The proposed work outperformed other techniques in terms of accuracy (0.63), precision (0.75), recall (0.97), F-Measure (0.85), Bleu-1(0.68),METEOR (0.17) , ROUGE-L (0.49), and CIDEr (0.573). The proposed work is compared to state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its accuracy.

                  In Brazil, the favorable weather conditions and abundant land contribute to the thriving agricultural production. Brazilian crops extensively employ pesticides due to their high efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and permissive regulatory framework. However, pesticide use also endangers water resources, animal organisms, and human health. Due to the lack of data on pesticide use in the Amazonas forest-based Brazil, the present study aimed to assess the levels of twenty-one current-use pesticides (CUPs) from five different classes in river waters collected from urban and riverside areas in this region. Moreover, the non-carcinogenic risks associated with water consumption were also characterized. Thirteen CUPs were detected in concentrations above the limit of detection (LOD) in at least one of the water samples, and most pesticides were detected in riverside areas. In contrast, only 18% of the analyzed samples were considered “clean,” with only one compound detected. Fenitrothion showed the highest concentration, with a mean value of 4.86 ng/mL (0.30–14.3 ng/mL). Up to 33% of the samples showed levels of fipronil above the LOD, an issue of environmental and human health concern, mainly because of the adverse effects observed in honeybees. Despite this, the human health risk assessment showed a target hazard quotient below one (HQ < 1) in adults for all substances, suggesting that pesticide exposure through water consumption should not mean risk for the riverside populations. Taking into account the large extension of Brazil, as well as its different agricultural practices throughout the country, it would be of great importance to conduct extensive research in other areas. It would help to gain knowledge in this field and to promote eco-friendly alternatives to mitigate pesticide use and, consequently, to reduce their potential adverse effects on human health and the ecosystems.

                  The study analyzed the survey data from the 2018 Portland E-scooter Pilot Program and aims to determine (i) who uses shared e-scooters and why they use them, and (ii) whether there is any association between e-scooter usage and the usage of other modes of transportation. To accomplish the first objective, the study identifies the users of shared e-scooters based on their travel behavior using an unsupervised machine learning approach, latent class analysis (LCA). The LCA model grouped e-scooter users into three distinct classes: Class 1 (Recreational Enthusiasts) −occasional and frequent users for recreation, Class 2 (Commute Riders) −frequent users for work, and Class 3 (Intermittent Joyriders) −occasional and one-time users for recreation. Furthermore, a set of ordered logit models is employed to determine the second objective based on the identified classes of e-scooter users, their socio-demographic characteristics, and the built environment variables. The results of ordered logit models revealed that compared to Commute Riders, both Recreational Enthusiasts and Intermittent Joyriders exhibit less interest in increasing the usage of available transportation modes after adopting e-scooters. Notably, low-income e-scooter users show a higher probability of increasing their usage across various transportation modes, including public transportation, driving, shared mobility services, personal bikes, shared bikes, and walking. The study offers valuable insights to guide city planners and policymakers in developing effective strategies for the deployment of e-scooters, targeting each group of users.

                  Air quality forecasting is vital for sustainable development in smart cities and is essential to protect public health through early warning against air pollutants. This article presents a novel ensemble deep learning method able to capture spatiotemporal features on short-term time intervals and extract high data abstraction levels. This method uses a hierarchical framework with a new activation function called HT-Tanh to improve the prediction of air pollutant emissions in real time. As such, a residual neural network (ResNet) is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to deeply extract the temporal and spatial features from pollutant and meteorological data. The model network encodes the fully connected layer to fine-tune the CNN output and decodes the temporal prediction relations based on gate recurrent unit (GRU) to obtain more accurate results. The reliability of the proposed method is verified through a case study from Shantou City, China. The model performance is compared with the recently developed and traditional deep learning models. Results reveal that the proposed method has good precision in the multiscale air quality predictions. Compared with CNN-GRU, convolutional long short-term memory, and CNN models, the forecasting results of the proposed method are significantly improved. The presented method in this article can support the early warning systems in multiple regions for air pollution modeling studies.

In general, the accuracy of machine learning model predictions is closely related to the quality and quantitative aspects of the data used, following the principle of garbage-in, garbage-out. In order to quantitatively and qualitatively augment datasets, one of the most prevalent concerns of data scientists is to generate synthetic data, which should follow as closely as possible the actual pattern of the original data. This study proposes three different data augmentation strategies based on fractal interpolation, namely the Closest Hurst Strategy, Closest Values Strategy and Formula Strategy. To validate the strategies, we used four public datasets from the literature, as well as a private dataset obtained from meteorological records in the city of Braşov, Romania. The prediction results obtained with the LSTM model using the presented interpolation strategies showed a significant accuracy improvement compared to the raw datasets, thus providing a possible answer to practical problems in the field of remote sensing and sensor sensitivity. Moreover, our methodologies answer some optimization-related open questions for the fractal interpolation step using Optuna framework."

Meso-scale cities are the most developed cities in China and play an important role in economic and social development. The current robot technology is mainly divided into industrial robots and service robots, which can play an important role in the development of cities. This paper aims to apply AI robotics technology to the analysis and intelligent management of mesoscale urban design genealogy. Firstly, the development pedigree of the mesoscale city was analyzed, from which the characteristics of previous designs could be clearly understood. Then, the urban management and control system is intelligently designed from many aspects, the characteristics of the robot are analyzed, and the application of the intelligent robot in urban design is introduced. After that, four developing meso‑scale cities in a province were selected as the evaluation objects, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was proposed to evaluate the application effect of robotics technology in meso‑scale cities. The results showed that the overall score of the robot in urban traffic design was greater than 70 points, and the overall score of urban architectural design was greater than 65 points, which was in the acceptable range. In the application score of urban environment design, the influence was about 70 to 80 points, and the aesthetics was more than 75 points. The cultural aspect of the design impact score was no more than 75 points, while the cultural support aspect score was around 80 points. After the weight calculation, the final overall score was 489 points, and the comprehensive average score was 36 points. The overall composite score and average score were both good. This showed that the application of robot technology to the pedigree analysis and intelligent management and control of mesoscale urban design could achieve good results."

                  With the exacerbation of global climate change and the growing environmental awareness among the general public, the concept of green consumption has gained significant attention across various sectors of society. As a representative example of green consumer products, energy-saving products play a crucial role in the timely realization of dual carbon goals. However, an analysis of online comments regarding energy-saving products reveals that the majority of these products still exhibit shortcomings in terms of efficacy, noise level, cost-effectiveness, and particularly, energy-saving appliances. This study focuses on the user-generated online comments data from the Taobao e-commerce platform for Grade 1 energy-saving refrigerators. By employing text mining techniques, the study aims to extract the essential information and sentiments expressed in the comments, in order to explore the consumption characteristics of Grade 1 energy-saving refrigerators. Moreover, the LBBA (LDA-Bert-BiLSTM-Attention) model is utilized to investigate the consumer topics of interest and emotional features. Initially, the LDA model is adopted to identify the attributes and weights of consumer concerns. Subsequently, the Bert model is pre-trained with the online comment data, and combined with the BiLSTM algorithm and Attention mechanism to predict sentiment categories. Finally, a transfer learning approach is utilized to determine the sentiment inclination of user-generated online comments and to identify the primary driving factors behind each sentiment category. This research employs sentiment analysis on online comments data regarding energy-saving products to uncover consumer sentiment attributes and emotional characteristics. It provides decision-makers with a comprehensive and systematic understanding of public consumption intentions, offering decision support for the efficient operation and management of the energy-saving product market.

Material and methods This study involves the development of an algorithm that harnesses the potential of artificial intelligence to create a geospatial model that highlights the different pathways of TB transmission. The modeling process itself is characterized by a series of key stages, including initialization of the city, calibration of health parameters, simulation of the working day, propagation of the spread of infection, the evolution of disease trajectories, rigorous statistical calculations and transition to the following day. A comprehensive description of the course of active tuberculosis is presented, following the official hypothesis recommended by the World Health Organization. A comprehensive simulation, illustrating the propagation of tuberculosis in an entirely healthy environment devoid of any preventive or therapeutic measures, is presented. To ascertain the adequacy of the model and its sensitivity to the principal parameters governing the course of tuberculosis, a series of experiments were meticulously conducted, employing three distinct approximations, namely: the basic model, the model incorporating mortality factors, and the comprehensive model, encompassing all relevant aspects. Conclusions The model's results exhibit stability and lack of significant fluctuations. The statistical values obtained for infected, latent, and recovered individuals align well with known medical data, confirming the model's adequacy."

This study focuses on predicting carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in Petaling Jaya using various machine learning models, and two important parameters, CO concentration and time, were considered in the analysis. Six distinct machine learning models were assessed to gauge their predictive capabilities. These models encompassed a range of regression modeling techniques namely; Linear, Tree, Gaussian Process, Ensemble of Trees, Support Vector, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) modelling. The Matern 5/2 Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model consistently outperformed other models across all scenarios, demonstrating high R2 values and low RMSE, MSE, and MAE values. Specifically, in scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4, the Matern 5/2 model exhibited the lowest RMSE (0.084–0.088) and highest R2 (0.97), highlighting its reliability and robustness in predicting CO concentrations. Additionally, the Rational Quadratic model achieved an R2 of 0.97 with an RMSE of 0.088 in scenario 1, while the Quadratic SVM excelled in scenario 3 with an R2 of 0.965 and low RMSE, MSE, and MAE values (0.085, 0.007, and 0.066). These findings provide valuable insights for environmental protection, renewable energy transition, energy efficiency, sustainable land use planning, and public awareness. However, acknowledging the study's single-area focus and potential limitations in representing diverse regions, further research is warranted to explore carbon emissions across varied areas and enhance the generalizability of the findings."

We scrutinize the existing literature analysing the norms, actors, and processes through which green school grounds are conceptualized, designed, implemented, and sustained. We find that good schoolyard governance is exhibited by: i) the actual use that children make of the naturalized areas, and by its repercussion on their physical and mental well-being, social integration, sense of place, and socio-environmental awareness; ii) the ways outdoor environments intersect with school curriculums; iii) by the availability of public support and funding lines with flexible, anticipatory and adaptive features; and crucially iv) by the ways that architects and gardeners engage with the concepts of ecology, creative play and outdoor education in the acts of schoolyard (re)making. We also find that at times focus on program effectiveness (efficiency, goals) infringes upon justice and inclusion. The way participative processes are interpreted, and eventually inform schoolyard designs and uses is one of the challenges to consider in this respect. Greening schoolyards also requires participation processes that are accessible and inclusive for adults and children from a variety of socio-cultural, ethnic and economic contexts. In a nutshell, naturalizing schoolyards needs to go beyond the search for narrow technical solutions for climate adaptation or pedagogical innovation, being a process of school (re)making. The governance framework suggested here is apt for analysing a range of urban green interventions"

                  Objective
                  Physical therapists and clinicians commonly confirm craniocervical posture (CCP), cervical retraction, and craniocervical flexion as screening tests because they contribute to non-specific neck pain (NSNP). We compared the predictive performance of statistical machine learning (ML) models for classifying individuals with and without NSNP using datasets containing CCP and cervical kinematics during pro- and retraction (CKdPR).
               
                  Design
                  Exploratory, cross-sectional design.
               
                  Setting and participants
                  In total, 773 public service office workers (PSOWs) were screened for eligibility (NSNP, 441; without NSNP, 332).
               
                  Methods
                  We set up five datasets (CCP, cervical kinematics during the protraction, cervical kinematics during the retraction, CKdPR and combination of the CCP and CKdPR). Four ML algorithms–random forest, logistic regression, Extreme Gradient boosting, and support vector machine–were trained.
               
                  Main outcome measures
                  Model performance were assessed using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. To interpret the predictions, we used Feature permutation importance and SHapley Additive explanation values.
               
                  Results
                  The random forest model in the CKdPR dataset classified PSOWs with and without NSNP and achieved the best AUC among the five datasets using the test data (AUC, 0.892 [good]; F1, 0.832). The random forest model in the CCP dataset had the worst AUC among the five datasets using the test data [AUC, 0.738 (fair); F1, 0.715].
               
                  Conclusion
                  ML performance was higher for the CKdPR dataset than for the CCP dataset, suggesting that ML algorithms are more suitable than classical statistical methods for developing robust models for classifying PSOWs with and without NSNP.

A path model is employed to capture how the four perceptions of environmental qualities (safety, liveliness, comfort, and legibility) and three dimensions of emotion (pleasure, arousal, dominance) are influenced by individual characteristics and cognitive appraisal using data collected in an online virtual reality experiment with 237 participants. Results show that emotional pleasure is more directly influenced by environmental attributes while arousal and dominance are closely related to a person's current mood and personality. Perceptions of environmental qualities do have mediating effects in emotion generation, but contribute differently to the three dimensions of emotion. Cognitive appraisal variables directly influence emotion generation, with ideal values always having positive effects and expected values always negative effects. The findings can help capture the dynamic process of emotional experiences between diverse individuals and may support experience-centered simulation and prediction."

Effective estimation methods are necessary for trip analysis and route planning, offering valuable insights into passengers’ mobility patterns and, subsequently, improving the quality of service. However, the stochastic nature of passenger behaviour challenges the degree of successful alighting estimates. A classic approach to infer the alighting stops of passengers is the use of trip-chaining principles. Since these principles are dispersed across the literature in the field, their comprehensive review is pivotal to establish the best practice for alighting estimation. Still, trip-chaining approaches are unable to infer the alighting of non-commuting passengers. This paper addresses these two research gaps by: i) providing a critical overview of the existing principles and methods for alighting estimation; ii) proposing an approach to improve alighting estimation that consistently integrates the most effective state-of-the-art principles on trip-chaining; and iii) further introducing a frequent pattern mining and density-based clustering solutions to support alighting estimation for non-commuting passengers. Considering the public bus transport in Lisbon city as the guiding case study, the achieved estimation rate by the proposed assembled model is 92%. Moreover, the density-based clustering solution is found to improve the estimation of 11pp against classic trip-chaining principles. Furthermore, the proposed model and acquired results yield actionable value to enhance PT operations and services, ultimately leading to improved bus routing and quality of service."

The maximum lateral displacement of pile wall is one of the important variables in controlling the stability of the excavation and its adjacent structures. Nowadays, the application of machine learning methods is widely used in engineering sciences due to its low cost and high speed of calculation. This paper utilized three intelligent machine learning algorithms based on the excavation method through soldier pile walls, namely eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), least square support vector regressor (LS-SVR), and random forest (RF), to predict maximum lateral displacement of pile walls. The results showed that the implemented XGBoost model performed excellently and could make predictions for maximum lateral displacement of pile walls with the mean absolute error of 0.1669, the highest coefficient of determination 0.9991, and the lowest root mean square error 0.3544. Although the LS-SVR, and RF models were less accurate than the XGBoost model, they provided good prediction results of maximum lateral displacement of pile walls for numerical outcomes. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most effective parameters in the XGBoost model. This analysis showed that soil elastic modulus and excavation height had a strong influence on of maximum lateral displacement of pile wall prediction."

                  Decentralized agriculture, improper monitoring of cultivation conditions, and leaching of contaminants into lands led to the contamination of crops with various potentially toxic elements (PTEs). However, it is essential to know more about the profile level and associated risk of these contaminants and their origin, especially in high-water content crops. This study aimed to investigate the concentration of PTEs in melons of one of Iran's southern cities and follow that health risk assessment in the target population for the first time. Results of the present study confirmed that although the mean concentration of some metals was lower than the safety standard (Cr: 4.6 ± 2 mg/kg and Pb: 7.4 ± 4 mg/kg), their nutritional value was unfavorable regarding some micronutrients (Cu: 88.8 ± 27 mg/kg and Zn: 480 ± 275 mg/kg). The highest metal concentration in cantaloupe was iron (1706.47 mg/kg, p-value<0.05), and nitrate concentration in all melon types was 2.59–524.54 mg/kg (p-value<0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) with K-means clustering and the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model have shown that contaminants in melons originated from human activities. So, excessive use of agricultural fertilizers is a possible source of nitrates in melons, which have 93 % of factor loading values. The health risk assessment also showed that melons' carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk using the deterministic method was lower than the permissible limit (HQ < 1, ILCR<E-4). However, the Monte Carlo simulation estimated HQ > 1 in the children group for the 95th percentile. Furthermore, the level of certainty in the carcinogenesis risk for children, women, and men was estimated at 86.48 %, 64.67 %, and 61.30 %, respectively. Also, the consumption rate was determined as the most important parameter in the sensitivity analysis. As a consequence, there is a potential health risk for Iranians after the consumption of melon due to PTEs and nitrate levels that also originated from anthropogenic sources.

To refine the precision and effectiveness of the prediction model, the gravitational algorithm is introduced to optimize parameter selection in the support vector machine model. A nationwide prediction model for green supply chain economic development efficiency is meticulously constructed by leveraging public economic, environmental, and demographic data. A comprehensive empirical analysis follows, revealing a noteworthy reduction in mean squared error and root mean squared error with increasing iterations, reaching a minimum of 0.007 and 0.103, respectively—figures that are the lowest among all considered machine learning models. Moreover, the mean absolute percentage error value is remarkably low at 0.0923. The data illustrate a gradual decline in average prediction error and standard deviation throughout the model optimization process, indicative of both model convergence and heightened prediction accuracy. These results underscore the significant potential of machine learning technology in optimizing supply chain and circular economy management. The paper provides valuable insights for decision-makers and researchers navigating the landscape of sustainable development."

                  The development of a nation's infrastructure is a defining paradigm. Due to the complexity of putting together and running such programs. For developing countries like India, the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model has emerged as one of the best suited ways of project delivery. India's developing economy necessitates efficient and timely project completion at the lowest possible cost. Government involvement and private sector expertise are combined in the PPP concept. Note that highway construction is crucial to the development of other types of infrastructure. However, highway construction is fraught with uncertainty due to factors like land acquisition, traffic management, weather, and more. Maintaining an economy's current rate of growth, high-quality infrastructure is the single most important factor. All modes of transportation fall under this category, from cars and buses to trains and planes, as well as the provision of potable water and agricultural irrigation. However, a lot of money is needed in this industry. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are being pushed to speed up infrastructure development and meet such needs. Private-public partnerships (PPPs) include both public- and private-sector collaborations. To provide the necessary structure and person capacities, governments that have embarked on PPPs projects have often created new policy, legal, and institutional frameworks. Following the identification of key factors affecting PPP performance, a case study of the Porbandar-Dwarka highway construction project is used to compare and contrast three distinct PPP (BOT-Toll, BOT- Annuity, and HAM) models. Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value are two key financial indicators that favor HAM over BOT-Toll and BOT-Annuity. Finally, the FIDIC requirements and the financial and legal conditions from the models are combined to suggest a new PPP framework. The particular findings of this study will help policymakers, investors, and planners in Gujarat complete future highway development projects on schedule and under budget.

                  Urban parks have been found to provide mental health benefits. Some empirical studies have tested natural features and perceptual measures respectively, announcing their contribution to psychological restoration. However, inconsistent findings were occasionally reported, whereas few attempts have been made to combine both observed and perceptual factors for validation. Little is known about the variation of restorative drivers and their spatial patterns. To address these problems, this study combined public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) and deep learning method to capture visual qualities of landscape features along with several important perceptual measures. A typical urban park in Wuhan, China, was selected for a pilot study, and 1560 crowdsourced on-site images were collected, with thematic and geographic information being integrated. A series of statistical models, e.g., OLS, QRM, and MGWR, were employed successively for validation. The results showed that landscape preference, place attachment, greenery and water were validated as the global explanatory factors to estimate the conditional mean of psychological restoration. The variation of influential effects of these factors were detected at different restoration levels. There exist spatial heterogeneity for these influential factors on restorative effects. Findings provided new knowledge on a deeper understanding of the subtlety of restoration drivers and their spatial patterns. The findings offered useful insights and guidance for urban planners in creating high-quality green parks with restorative values.

                  Methods
                  Five ML models (support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron neural network, and lasso) were applied to clinical and image data from baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 for predicting 4 VA outcomes (≥ 15-letter VA gain, ≥ 15-letter VA loss, VA change from baseline, and actual VA) at 2 years. The CATT data from 1029 participants were randomly split for training (n = 717), from which the models were trained using 10-fold cross-validation, and for final validation on a test data set (n = 312).

                     2 of 0.37 to 0.45 (MAE = 8.8–10.2 letters) for predicting actual VA at 2 years, and AUCs of 0.85 to 0.87 and 0.67 to 0.79 for predicting ≥ 15-letter VA gain and loss, respectively.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Machine learning models have the potential to predict 2-year VA response to anti-VEGF treatment using clinical and imaging features from the loading dose phase, which can aid in decision-making around treatment protocols for patients with nAMD.

Specifically, CO directly affects cardiovascular and other organ tissues and leads to numerous chronic diseases and major public health problems. The effective implementation of a deep learning model for predicting variations in CO levels would enable the early formulation of policies for controlling air pollution. In this study, a seasonal gated recurrent unit (SGRU) model, which is a deep learning time-series prediction model, was developed to predict the levels of CO in Taiwan. Atmospheric CO measurements from 2005 to 2021 were collected from the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan and preprocessed using the Kalman filter to achieve accurate forecasting. The performance of the proposed SGRU model was compared with that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA, exponential smoothing (ETS), Holt–Winters ETS, support vector regression, and seasonal long short-term memory models in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error. The SGRU model achieved the lowest MAPE value of 0.94, which demonstrated its superior performance. The construction of an accurate air pollution prediction model can assist government entities in formulating health and social care strategies and in planning future air pollution control measures."

                  The Urban Transit Routing Problem (UTRP) is an NP-hard discrete problem that deals with the design of routes for public transport systems. It is a highly complex, multiply constrained problem, while the evaluation of candidate route sets can prove both challenging and time-consuming, with many potential solutions rejected on the grounds of infeasibility. Due to its difficulty, metaheuristic methods, such us swarm intelligence algorithms, are considered highly suitable for the UTRP. The suitability of these methods heavily relies on the correct adaptation of the chosen method for a discrete-space problem, the initialization procedure, and the solution evaluation method. In this context, this study proposes an artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm for the efficient solution of the UTRP, presenting a novel discrete-space adaptation of the former. The results are subsequently compared to 14 other algorithms, including evolutionary, swarm intelligence and hyper-heuristic implementations, using Mandl’s widely used and accepted benchmark. Comparison of the produced solutions with published results on Mandl’s benchmark network, shows that the developed algorithm yields superior results to the existing techniques, yielding very high shares of direct trip coverage, which is vital for transit systems to attract riders and contribute to urban sustainability. A new indicator for operator cost calculation is also developed and integrated into our analysis, offering insights on the trade-offs between user and operator costs. Differences in generated solutions, influenced by the weighting factor value, can result in variations of up to 13% in direct trip coverage and 1.5 minutes in average travel time.

The Maximal Coverage Billboard Location Problem (MCBLP) is complex, especially for multi-objective functions. A multi-objective spatial optimization model was developed using mixed-integer linear programming based on MCBLP to formulate the spatial optimization problem of determining billboard locations. Combining the distinctive features of location problems, we have developed a new approach called ReCovNet that utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the MCBLP. We applied the ReCovNet to address a real-world billboard location problem in New York City. To assess its performance, we implemented various algorithms such as Gurobi solver, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a deep learning baseline called Attention Model (AM). The Gurobi reports the optimal solutions, while GA and AM serve as benchmark algorithms. Our proposed approach achieves a good balance between efficiency and accuracy and effectively solves MCBLP. The ReCovNet introduced in our study has potential to improve advertising effectiveness, and our proposed approach offers novel insights for addressing the MCBLP."

                  Pedestrians represent a population of vulnerable road users who are directly exposed to complex traffic conditions, thereby increasing their risk of injury or fatality. This study first constructed a multidimensional indicator to quantify pedestrian exposure, considering factors such as Point of Interest (POI) attributes, POI intensity, traffic volume, and pedestrian walkability. Following risk interpolation and feature engineering, a comprehensive data source for risk prediction was formed. Finally, based on risk factors, the VT-NET deep learning network model was proposed, integrating the algorithmic characteristics of the VGG16 deep convolutional neural network and the Transformer deep learning network. The model involved training non-temporal features and temporal features separately. The training dataset incorporated features such as weather conditions, exposure intensity, socioeconomic factors, and the built environment. By employing different training methods for different types of causative feature variables, the VT-NET model analyzed changes in risk features and separately trained temporal and non-temporal risk variables. It was used to generate spatiotemporal grid-level predictions of crash risk across four spatiotemporal scales. The performance of the VT-NET model was assessed, revealing its efficacy in predicting pedestrian crash risks across the study area. The results indicated that areas with concentrated crash risks are primarily located in the city center and persist for several hours. These high-risk areas dissipate during the late night and early morning hours. High-risk areas were also found to cluster in the city center; this clustering behavior was more prominent during weekends compared to weekdays and coincided with commercial zones, public spaces, and educational and medical facilities.

We investigated whether exposure to and information about air pollution differs by sociodemographic factors in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the second most populous city in Brazil with dense urban areas, for 2012–2017. We developed machine learning-based models to estimate daily levels of O3, PM10, and PM2.5 using high-dimensional datasets from satellite remote sensing, atmospheric and land variables, and land use information. Cross-validations demonstrated good agreement between the estimated levels and measurements from ground-based monitoring stations: overall R 2 of 76.8 %, 63.9 %, and 69.1 % for O3, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. We conducted univariate regression analyses to investigate whether long-term exposure to O3, PM2.5, PM10 and distance to regulatory monitors differs by socioeconomic indicators, the percentages of residents who were children (0-17 years) or age 65+ years in 154 neighborhoods. We also examined the number of days exceeding the Brazilian National Air Quality Standard (BNAQS). Long-term exposures to O3 and PM2.5 were higher in more socially deprived neighborhoods. An interquartile range (IQR) increment of the social development index (SDI) was associated with a 3.6 μg/m3 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2.9, 4.4; p-value≤0.001) decrease in O3, and 0.3 μg/m3 (95 % CI: 0.2, 0.5; p-value = 0.010) decrease in PM2.5. An IQR increase in the percentage of residents who are children was associated with a 4.1 μg/m3 (95 % CI: 3.1, 5.0; p-value≤0.001) increase in O3, and 0.4 μg/m3 (95 % CI: 0.3, 0.6; p-value = 0.009) increase in PM2.5. An IQR increase in the percentage of residents age ≥65was associated with a 3.3 μg/m3 (95 % CI: 2.4, 4.3; p-value=<0.001) decrease in O3, and 0.3 μg/m3 (95 % CI: 0.1, 0.5; p-value = 0.058) decrease in PM2.5. There were no apparent associations for PM10. The association for daily O3 levels exceeding the BNAQS daily standard was 0.4 %p–0.8 %p different by the IQR of variables, indicating a 7–15 days difference in the six-year period. The association for daily PM2.5 levels exceeding the BNAQS daily standard showed a 0.7–1.5 %p difference by the IQR, meaning a 13–27 days difference in the period. We did not find statistically significant associations between the distance to monitors and neighborhood characteristics but some indication regarding SDI. We found that O3 levels were higher in neighborhoods situated farther from monitoring stations, suggesting that elevated levels of air pollution may not be routinely measured. Exposure disparity patterns may vary by pollutants, suggesting a complex interplay between environmental and socioeconomic factors in environmental justice."

Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource-Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekers’ need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision-making process. Our study advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively navigate AI's integration into public decision-making processes. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on trustworthy AI, offering a detailed case study that bridges the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application. By scrutinizing the AI implementation in the Swedish PES, we provide valuable insights and guidelines for other public sector organizations grappling with the integration of AI into their decision-making processes."

The aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to analyze the role of thromboelastography in predicting rebleeding after hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Basic methods We selected 375 patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage who underwent surgical treatment in Yuebei People's Hospital of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province from May 2018 to August 2022, and retrospectively analyzed the relevant data of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage patients (including general data and clinical thromboelastography data), and analyzed the factors and thromboelastography parameters that affect rebleeding after surgery (45 cases, defined as re-examination of head CT within 72 h after surgery showed that the hematoma in the surgical area exceeded 20 ml). Main results Time from symptom onset to surgery, taking antiplatelet drugs, taking anticoagulant drugs, diabetes mellitus, difficulty in hemostasis during surgery, R value and EPL value in thromboelastography were risk factors for rebleeding after hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (P < 0.05). Logistic regression was used to determine the independent risk factors, and based on these risk factors, a nomogram was established and internally validated using a bootstrap method. ROC curve analysis showed that the nomogram model had high diagnostic value for rebleeding after hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, with AUC of 0.7314. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed good consistency between the predicted probabilities and the observed values. The decision curve analysis and clinical impact curve also revealed the potential clinical usefulness of the nomogram.

The transformation reforms modern technology and digital infrastructure adoption to facilitate growth and inclusivity. These conditions make the agricultural digitization transformation more appealing. Therefore, using a survey of 400 smallholder farmers in four regions of Rukwa, Ruvuma, Morogoro and Tabora, this study examines the interplay between digitalization and agriculture transformation in Tanzania by focusing on the determinants and effects of digitalization on smallholder farmers' welfare. The study used the double hurdle model to estimate the determinants and extent of digitalization adoption; the Two-stage least square (2SLS) and the Control function approach (CFA) to estimate its effects on smallholder farmers' welfare. The findings revealed that access to credit (0.17428, p < 0.01), extension services (0.52884, p < 0.01), education and government support (0.10922, p < 0.05) are key determinants for agricultural digitalization. Moreover, digitalization was found to influence smallholder farmers' welfare significantly. The benefits of digitalization across smallholder farmers in all regions were observed in enhancing extension services (76.50 %), pest management (71.25 %), and accessibility of the market information (72.25 %), enhance an access to financial services (74.75 %). In sum, to promote digital technology adoption among smallholder farmers, policymakers in Tanzania and developing nations should prioritize financial inclusion through tailored microfinance programs, educational initiatives must integrate digital literacy, enhance extension services, subsidized technology access, and encouraging public-private partnerships to create incentives for sustainable agricultural development."

                  With numerous location choices across dispersed markets and a lack of detailed store-level information, the initial screening process for selecting store locations is challenging. We propose a machine learning-based model that uses public city-, competitor-, and point-of-interest (POI)-level data, including target group indices (TGIs), and apply machine learning to recommend sites based on predicted store performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with real data from a jewelry retailing chain. Three machine learning approaches were developed and tested using data from 743 same-brand jewelry stores, and we find that a customized sequential ensemble model performs the best and outperforms the best available industry benchmarks. Our approach offers a new scalable and cost-efficient screening process for retailers to identify potentially top-performing locations.

This paper therefore examines the potential impact of ChatGPT on learning and assessment, using the example of academic essays, being a major form of assessment with widespread applications of ChatGPT. This provides an opportunity to unpack broader insights on the challenge of generative AI's to the relevance, quality and credibility of higher education learning in a rapidly changing 21st century knowledge economy. We conducted a quasi-experiment in which we deployed ChatGPT to generate academic essays in response to a typical assessment brief, and then subjected the essays to plagiarism checks and independent grading. The results indicate that ChatGPT is able to generate highly original, and high quality, contents from distinct individual accounts in response to the same assessment brief. However, it is unable to generate multiple original contents from the same account, and it struggled with referencing. The discussion highlights the need for higher education providers to rethink their approach to assessment, in response to disruption precipitated by artificial intelligence. Thus, following the discussion of empirical data, we propose a new conceptual framework for AI-assisted assessment for lifelong learning, in which the parameters of assessment extend beyond knowledge (know what) testing, to competence (know how) assessment and performance (show how) evaluation."

                  User equilibrium (UE) has long been regarded as the cornerstone of transport planning studies. Despite its fundamental importance, our understanding of the actual UE state of road networks has remained surprisingly incomplete. Using big datasets of taxi trajectories, this study investigates the UE states of road networks in two Chinese mega-cities, i.e., Wuhan and Shenzhen. Effective indicators, namely relative gaps, are introduced to quantify how actual traffic states deviate from theoretical UE states. Advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and SHAP values, are employed to analyze nonlinear relationships between network disequilibrium states and seven influencing factors extracted from trajectory data. The results in these two study areas reveal consistent and significant gaps between actual traffic states and the theoretical UE states at various times of the day during both weekdays and weekends. The XGBoost analysis shows that differences in travel distances, travel speeds, and signalized intersection numbers among alternative routes are the primary causes of road network disequilibrium. The results of this study could present several important methodological and policy implications for using the UE models in transport applications.

                  Accurate prediction of building energy consumption is crucial to the rational scheme of building energy. Combining the entropy-weighted K-means (EWKM) with the random forest (RF) method, a feature selection (EWKM-RF) method is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed EWKM-RF method, the classification and feature selection of the energy consumption influencing factors can be achieved exclusively. Meanwhile, based on the EWKM-RF method and the bi-directional long-short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) optimized by the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), an RF-SSA-BiLSTM prediction model for building energy consumption is established in this paper. As the weight, learning rate, and hidden layer node parameters of the BiLSTM neural network are optimized with the SSA, the constraints for manually adjusting parameters are avoided in the proposed prediction model. To examine the accuracy of the proposed model, energy consumption data of a civil public building in Dalian city are collected and tested. Results show the prediction error of RF-SSA-BiLSTM after feature selection is reduced by 24.55 % in high and low energy consumption months. Compared with RF-BiLSTM, RF-PSO-BiLSTM, and RF-CNN-BiLSTM, the RF-SSA-BiLSTM has strong robustness. The average MAE, RMSE and MAPE values of energy consumption prediction in the four seasons are 1.30, 1.63 and 0.02.

Understanding the factors that increase exposure is crucial for promoting healthier urban environments. Machine learning models have successfully predicted air pollutant concentrations, but they tend to be less interpretable than classical statistical ones, such as linear models. This study aimed to develop a predictive model to assess cyclists’ exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in urban environments. The model was generated using geo-temporally referenced data and machine learning techniques. We explored several models and found that the gradient boosting machine learning model best fitted the PM2.5 predictions, with a minimum root mean square error value of 5.62 μg m−3. The variables with greatest influence on cyclist exposure were the temporal ones (month, day of the week, and time of the day), followed by meteorological variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure. Additionally, we considered relevant attributes, which are partially linked to spatial characteristics. These attributes encompass street typology, vegetation density, and the flow of vehicles on a particular street, which quantifies the number of vehicles passing a given point per minute. Mean PM2.5 concentration was lower in bicycle paths away from vehicular traffic than in bike lanes along streets. These outcomes underscore the need to thoughtfully design public transportation routes, including bus routes, concerning the network of bicycle pathways. Such strategic planning attempts to improve the air quality in urban landscapes."

                  Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent tool in the modern day. The utilization of AI and advanced language models such as chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) and Bard is not only innovative but also crucial for handling challenges related to water research. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversations. ChatGPT has recently gained considerable public interest, owing to its unique ability to simplify tasks from various backgrounds. Similarly, Google introduced Bard, an AI-powered chatbot to simulate human conversations. Herein, we investigated how ChatGPT and Bard (AI powdered chatbots) tools can impact water research through interactive sessions. Typically, ChatGPT and Bard offer significant benefits to various fields, including research, education, scientific publications, and outreach. ChatGPT and Bard simplify complex and challenging tasks. For instance, 50 important questions about water treatment/desalination techniques and 50 questions about water harvesting techniques were provided to both chatbots. Time analytics was performed by ChatGPT 3.5, and Bard was used to generate full responses. In particular, the effectiveness of this emerging tool for research purposes in the field of conventional water treatment techniques, advanced water treatment techniques, membrane technology and seawater desalination has been thoroughly demonstrated. Moreover, potential pitfalls and challenges were also highlighted. Thus, sharing these experiences may encourage the effective and responsible use of Bard and ChatGPT in research purposes. Finally, the responses were compared from the perspective of an expert. Although ChatGPT and Bard possess huge benefits, there are several issues, which are discussed in this study. Based on this study, we can compare the abilities of artificial intelligence and human intelligence in water sector research.

We have discussed a prototype for the identification of potholes and speed bumps in order to guarantee safe mobility. Such critical road quality data may be made public or shared with local governments and other government agencies for the purpose of corrective action and road maintenance. A pothole detection system using image processing and cloud storage can be used to detect potholes from footage provided by a device, store the information into a cloud database, and analyze the data to identify areas that need repair. The system can also send alerts to users about upcoming potholes and notify road maintenance authorities of new pothole detections. In brief, the system uses image processing to detect potholes and cloud storage to store and analyze the data. It can also send alerts to users and road maintenance authorities. The model was built using YOLOv5 and trained on 70% of the dataset images. It was able to detect potholes with good accuracy in the output images."

This paper focuses on the possibility of using large-scale language models (LSMs) as an innovative tool to address this challenge. Based on a careful literature review and analysis of current trends in artificial intelligence, the author team develops a concept for integrating GPTs into police practice, with an emphasis on the potential for reducing administrative burden and supporting efficient processing of relevant information. As part of this research, we have identified key areas of policing where AI could bring significant value, including data analysis and document production assistance. However, it should be emphasized that this technology is still in its early stages of development and its implementation would require a carefully considered approach involving interdisciplinary collaboration and further research to test the theoretical assumptions presented in this study. Thus, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of integrating GPT into policing practice and outlines a path towards future innovative solutions in the field of public safety."

                  People's risk perception varies across different environments. However, how different environments influence people's COVID-19 risk perception (RP), especially street environments, has yet to be fully evaluated. This study explores how three different types of street environments influence people's COVID-19 RP. First, we used pedestrian-centric street-view images and machine-learning models to predict the severity of COVID-19 RP in the study area. In addition, geographically weighted regression models were constructed to assess the locally most important environmental factors and their spatial heterogeneity. The results showed that openness was the most important influencing factor on COVID-19 RP in all three types of streets, while visual crowdedness was the least important one. Moreover, the high-value clusters of COVID-19 RP mostly occurred in poor- and medium-quality commercial streets, poor-quality residential streets, and leisure streets close to the plaza. Contrastingly, the low-value aggregations of COVID-19 RP mainly appeared in high-quality commercial streets, medium- and high-quality residential streets, and leisure streets close to blue space. We also found that the importance of environmental factors varied greatly by location. Interestingly, the RP was lower with higher visual crowdedness for all types of commercial streets. Based on this, the COVID-19 RP in different types of street environments was comprehensively evaluated so that city-relevant departments can take more effective measures to manage the public health risk based on geographical features.

                  Rapid urbanization has resulted in problems with pollution, traffic congestion, and public transportation in cities worldwide. Much urbanization research disproportionately focuses on cities in developed countries, where data is easier to obtain, to the detriment of cities in developing countries. To help address this gap, our work proposes a machine learning methodology that explores how land use patterns contribute to predicting an aspect of public transportation in growing cities (aggregate public vehicle speeds), with Cauayan City in the Philippines as the test case. We trained gradient-boosting tree models with road properties, day and time, and land use data as features to predict vehicle speeds on various roads in the city. Among various feature combinations used in training, the best model used road, time, and land use features over a range buffer radii of 50 to 1000 m, yielding an R
                     2 of 0.676 (0.003) and a root mean squared error of 6.61 (0.03) kph. Apart from predicting speeds, Shapley's additive explanation (SHAP) values show that proximity to dense residential and commercial areas decreases predicted vehicle speeds. Our approach uses interpretable machine learning models to obtain insights about urban transportation in developing cities.

                  Computational intelligence (CI) has the potential to help tackle some of the world's most challenging social problems. Real-life examples of AI are already being applied in about one-third of these use cases They range from diagnosing cancer to helping blind people navigate their surroundings, identifying victims of online sexual exploitation, and aiding disaster-relief efforts etc. AI is only part of a much broader tool kit of measures that can be used to tackle societal issues, however. For now, issues such as data accessibility and shortages of AI talent constrain its application for social good. This chapter has grouped use cases into 10 social-impact domains based on taxonomies in use among social-sector organizations. Each use case highlights a type of meaningful problem that can be solved by one or more AI capability. The cost of human suffering, and the value of alleviating it, are impossible to gauge and compare. Nonetheless, employing usage frequency as a proxy, we measure the potential impact of different AI capabilities.

                  Forecasting the air quality index (AQI) is a critical and pressing challenge for developing nations worldwide. With air pollution emerging as a significant threat to the environment, this study considers seven study sites of the sub-tropical region in Bangladesh and introduces a novel hybrid deep-learning model. The proposed model, expressed as CLSTM-BiGRU, integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long-short term memory (LSTM), and a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) network. Leveraging nineteen remotely sensed predictor variables and harnessing the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, the CLSTM-BiGRU model showcases its superiority in air quality forecasting. It consistently outperforms the benchmark models, yielding lower forecasting errors and higher efficiency (i.e., correlation coefficient 
                        ~
                     1) values. Hence, this study underscores the feasibility and substantial potential of the hybrid deep learning model, which can provide precise forecasts of air quality index, and will be highly useful for relevant stakeholders and decision-makers. Furthermore, the adaptability and potential utility of this innovative model may be ascertained for air quality monitoring and effective public health risk mitigation in urban environments.

As one of the important ways to enhance the living environment, relevant government departments have accelerated the construction of urban streetscapes; however, certain issues, such as emphasis on surface and light protection, still persist. The visual effects of street landscapes hardly meet people's daily and spiritual needs. Therefore, assessing the quality of urban streetscapes has scientific and practical significance for improving urban planning and construction and creating a new intelligent and green city. In this study, the spatial distribution of vehicle interference index, spatial feasibility index, road area index, green visual index, sky visibility index, spatial enclosure index, color richness index, and visual entropy evaluation indices were drawn from the framework of combining deep learning and machine learning to quantify the spatial quality of urban streets by integrating a large number of streetscape images. The spatial quality of street landscape was evaluated according to the ELO scoring mechanism and random forest method, taking the main urban area of Fuzhou City as an example. The results showed that the overall street landscape quality of Fuzhou City was high, and the spatial distribution showed a pattern of concentrated high values in the center and dispersed high values in the periphery. Therefore, based on quantifying the spatial quality of urban streets, strategies, such as the pavement layout of pedestrian and vehicular paths, control of the continuity and permeability of visual landscape elements, and plant color matching, should be regulated. The method proposed in this study can provide novel insights for urban builders to improve the construction of cities."

The development of information technology, specifically the advancements in deep learning technology, has provided new solutions for rural revitalization. This article aims to optimize the spatial structure of rural residential areas and investigate models for optimizing spatial design layouts within the context of rural revitalization utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (DeepLab v3+). This article conducts in-depth research on the DeepLab v3+model and finds that it has good feature extraction ability in processing spatial information such as rural residential houses and ancillary land. By introducing an attention mechanism in the encoding region, we improved the feature extraction accuracy of the model. On the ImageNet and CoCo2017 datasets, the accuracy indicators PA, IoU, and F1 of the DeepLab v3+model performed well, reaching 98.25 %, 75.61 %, and 86.49 %, as well as 98.31 %, 74.91 %, and 85.49 %, respectively. Furthermore, it was discovered that as the training frequency approached 20, both ResNet50 and DeepLab v3-SE exhibited a generalization accuracy of 86.83 % and 89.26 %, correspondingly. This shows the effectiveness of our model in acquiring and utilizing knowledge during the training. The study further investigated the performance of the model in processing images with noise. When the noise standard deviation is 25, the mean SSIM of the O-DeepLab v3+network reaches 0.943, which is 0.53 % and 1.95 % higher than the DeepLab v3-SE network and traditional DeepLab v3+network, respectively. When the noise standard deviation is 50, the SSIM mean of the O-DeepLab v3+network reaches 0.82, which is 0.61 % and 1.49 % higher than the DeepLab v3-SE network and traditional DeepLab v3+network, respectively. This suggests that our model exhibits robustness when processing noisy images. In summary, the spatial design layout optimization model based on deep learning in the context of rural revitalization studied in this article has high accuracy and stability in processing spatial information such as rural residential houses and ancillary land. This is of great significance for optimizing rural land use, promoting urban-rural land allocation, and achieving rural revitalization. Therefore, this study has certain application value."

However, traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods for temperature forecasting become increasingly costly and time-consuming as forecast resolution improves. To overcome these challenges, recent studies have embraced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this paper, we select five AI models: Multiple linear regression, Support Vector Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Long Short-Term Memory, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to forecast extreme temperatures in nine representative Chinese cities, which are Harbin, Xian, Beijing, and Lhasa in the North and Shanghai, Guiyang, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Haikou in the South. To assess the performances, we compare AI models with two benchmarks: the persistence method by using the previous day's temperature extremes directly, and the prediction from the NWP method of the Global Forecast System (GFS) provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Among the 7 models forecasting daily extreme temperatures in nine cities, the MLP model outperforms the best, followed by the GBRT model. Compared with the persistence forecast, all 5 AI models and GFS show forecasting ability for daily maximum temperature. However, the GFS performs worse than the persistence model for daily minimum temperature. Specifically, for the MLP model, the average Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) for forecasting daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the 9 cities are 1.61 °C and 1.14 °C, reducing the GFS model's MAEs for daily maximum and minimum temperatures forecasts by 15% and 45%, respectively. Overall, AI models show promise in enhancing temperature forecasting accuracy."

While limited data suggest the presence of ARGs in beach environments, efficient prediction tools are needed for monitoring and detecting ARGs to ensure public health safety. This study aims to develop interpretable machine learning methods for predicting ARGs in beach waters, addressing the challenge of black-box models and enhancing our understanding of their internal mechanisms. Methods In this study, we systematically collected beach water samples and subsequently isolated bacteria from these samples using various differential and selective media supplemented with different antibiotics. Resistance profiles of bacteria were determined by using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Further, ARGs were enumerated by using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect and quantify ARGs. The obtained qPCR data and hydro-meteorological were used to create an ML model with high prediction performance and we further used two explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) model-agnostic interpretation methods to describe the internal behavior of ML model. Results Using qPCR, we detected bla CTX−M, bla NDM, bla CMY, bla OXA, bla tetX, bla sul1, and bla aac(6′-Ib-cr) in the beach waters. Further, we developed ML prediction models for bla aac(6′-Ib-cr), bla sul1, and bla tetX using the hydro-metrological and qPCR-derived data and the models demonstrated strong performance, with R2 values of 0.957, 0.997, and 0.976, respectively. Conclusions Our findings show that environmental factors, such as water temperature, precipitation, and tide, are among the important predictors of the abundance of resistance genes at beaches."

                  Data on plant growth regulators (PGRs) in common fruits and vegetables remain deficient. Supermarkets and farmers’ markets in three districts, two counties, and one city in Yinchuan with high traffic flow were selected and randomly sampled using the five-point sampling method. The QuEChERS pre-treatment method, combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, was used for detection. High-end exposure to PGRs was calculated via the chronic dietary risk assessment method from the point assessment model. The linearity of the components was good, (range: 0.2–100 ng/mL) with correlation coefficients ≥ 0.9962. Of the 25 PGRs examined, 16 were detected. The exceedances were as follows: chlormequat chloride and succinic acid 2,2-dimethylhydrazide in three and one batches of fruits, respectively, and gibberellin in four and six batches of vegetables, respectively. The same batch of fruits and vegetables could contain multiple PGRs, with seven PGRs detected in green dates and six in strawberries. In total, 10 batches of sprouts, six batches of fresh mushrooms, five of fruits and vegetables, one of leafy vegetables, and one of melons had excessive amounts of PGRs. The mean and median exposures were 0.0–0.832 mg/d and 0.0–0.453 mg/d, respectively. Although individual exceedances of PGRs were observed, most were at low levels, indicating that the corresponding risk was acceptable for human consumption.

                  BACKGROUND
                  Current guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy include the use of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, although there is no designation of which is the preferred option.
               
                  OBJECTIVE
                  This study aimed to compare viral suppression at delivery among patients on dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors combined with either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. A hypothesis was made that the incidence of viral suppression is higher with the use of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone combined with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor than with the use of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone combined with a protease inhibitor.
               
                  STUDY DESIGN
                  This study was an observational study of pregnant patients living with HIV who received prenatal care and delivered after 20 weeks of gestation at an urban safety net hospital. All pregnant patients with HIV were referred to a centralized clinic for HIV counseling, medication management, and prenatal care. Antiretroviral therapy was continued or initiated according to protocols based on national guidance. Among patients on a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone combined with integrase strand transfer inhibitor vs protease inhibitor at delivery, we compared the demographics and HIV disease characteristics, including year of diagnosis, viral load, and antiretroviral therapy class. The outcome of interest was viral suppression at delivery, defined as a viral load of <50 copies/mL.
               
                  RESULTS
                  From January 2011 to December 2021, 604 patients on dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor met the inclusion criteria, including 411 patients (68%) on protease inhibitor and 193 patients (32%) on integrase strand transfer inhibitor at delivery. Demographic distribution was similar, and prenatal care was initiated at 12 weeks of gestation. Among the integrase strand transfer inhibitor group, 101 (17%) were on antiretroviral therapy at initiation of prenatal care compared with 169 (28%) in the protease inhibitor group. At delivery, the frequency of viral load suppression was higher among those on an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (147/193 [76%]) than among those on a protease inhibitor (275/411 [67%]) (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–2.33). Among those with a detectable virus, quantitative viral load was not different. During the study period, the use of a protease inhibitor decreased, whereas the use of an integrase strand transfer inhibitor increased.
               
                  CONCLUSION
                  Among pregnant patients living with HIV, viral suppression was more common among those on a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone combined with integrase strand transfer inhibitor than among those on a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone protease inhibitor at delivery. Our results support the use of dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with integrase strand transfer inhibitor as a first-line antiretroviral therapy regimen in pregnancy.

                  Ensuring the safety and security of crowded places is a major concern for both the government and the public. Accurately and quickly estimating the number of people in a crowd is crucial for public safety, urban planning, and traffic monitoring. The existing methods have a minimum mean square error of 0.89 and require high storage space, making them inappropriate for crowd counting using low-computation and small-storage devices like single-board computers. Furthermore, these methods suffer from prediction time lag and are not suitable for live streaming. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a Deep Convolution Neural Network-based ‘CrowdDCNN’ model for crowd counting. This model reduces the value of mean square error by 0.29 and the size of the model by 80.01%. Additionally, the prediction time was decreased to 700 ms. Further, the ‘NoLag’ algorithm introduced in this paper is efficient in live crowd counting. Its O(1) time and space complexity make it appropriate for all devices, including single-board computers, laptops, and GPUs. The reported 0-p value during statistical analysis using Wilcoxon test, Friedman rank test, and paired t-test validates the superiority of the proposed model.

Methods A total of 8025, 7808, and 4887 respondents aged 60 years and above were selected from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2016, 2018, and 2020, respectively. DS was assessed using a short version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Twenty-two associated factors from six categories were included in random forest (RF) models. All urban-rural comparisons were conducted based on good model performance. Results The DS prevalence among all rural elderly was significantly higher than corresponding urban elderly. This disparity continued to widen among younger elderly, while it continued to narrow among older elderly. The top 10 common leading factors were sleep quality, self-rated health, life satisfaction, memory ability, child relationship, IADL disability, marital status, educational level, and gender. Urban-rural disparities in sleep quality, interpersonal trust, and child relationship continued to widen, while disparities in multimorbidity, hospitalization status, and frequency of family dinner continued to narrow. Limitation This study may exist recall bias and lacks causal explanation. Conclusions Significant and continuing disparities in the DS prevalence were observed between urban and rural elderly in China, showing opposite trends in younger and older elderly. The top 10 leading associated factors for DS were nearly consistent across urban and rural elderly, with sleep quality having strongest contribution. Urban-rural disparities in associated factors also showed different trends. This study provides a reference for mental health promotion among Chinese elderly."

                  This study examined the washoff of Bacillus globigii (Bg) spores from concrete, asphalt, and grass surfaces by stormwater. Bg is a nonpathogenic surrogate for Bacillus anthracis, which is a biological select agent. Areas (2.74 m × 7.62 m) of concrete, grass, and asphalt were inoculated twice at the field site during the study. Spore concentrations were measured in runoff water after seven rainfall events (1.2–65.4 mm) and complimentary watershed data were collected for soil moisture, depth of water in collection troughs, and rainfall using custom-built telemetry units. An average surface loading of 107.79 Bg spores/m2 resulted in peak spore concentrations in runoff water of 102, 260, and 4.1 CFU/mL from asphalt, concrete, and grass surfaces, respectively. Spore concentrations in the stormwater runoff were greatly reduced by the third rain event after both inoculations, but still detectable in some samples. When initial rainfall events occurred longer after the initial inoculation, the spore concentrations (both peak and average) in the runoff were diminished. The study also compared rainfall data from 4 tipping bucket rain gauges and a laser disdrometer and found they performed similarly for values of total rainfall accumulation while the laser disdrometer provided additional information (total storm kinetic energy) useful in comparing the seven different rain events. The soil moisture probes are recommended for assistance in predicting when to sample sites with intermittent runoff. Sampling trough level readings were critical to understanding the dilution factor of the storm event and the age of the sample collected. Collectively the spore and watershed data are useful for emergency responders faced with remediation decisions after a biological agent incident as the results provide insight into what equipment to deploy and that spores may persist in runoff water at quantifiable levels for months. The spore measurements are also a novel dataset for stormwater model parameterization for biological contamination of urban watersheds.

                  This study aimed at developing a machine learning-based COVID-19 transmission risk spatial model and an analysis of the public spatial awareness in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in their spatial environment (i.e., a spatial-based COVID-19 transmission risk model). Random Forest model combined with Information Gain was used in this study. Twenty-three geospatial variables that passed a feature selection process were inputted to build a spatial-based COVID-19 transmission risk model. The validation outcome reveals that Random Forest (RF) model achieved excellent COVID-19 transmission risk prediction result (AUC value of 94.7%). Transmission risk modeling results show that the moderate-to-high class risk pattern was concentrated in residential areas with complex road infrastructure. The model showed that land use, road infrastructure, minimum temperature, and close to urban areas is important for spatial modeling of COVID-19 transmission risk. The results of the public spatial awareness analysis show variations in respondents' use of PPE based on their spatial environment. They tend to carry one PPE whose use increases significantly from low-risk to high-risk. While being indoor, the majority used hand sanitizer, and a face mask when being outdoor. Thus, developing a spatial-based COVID-19 transmission risk prediction linked with public spatial awareness can be used as a reference to establish health policies or regulations by decision-makers, health boards, and governments to control and simultaneously reduce the risk of transmission more effectively and efficiently.

                  President Biden’s executive order, ‘Strengthening the Nation's Forests, Communities, and Local Economies,’ (EO#14072, April 22, 2022) acknowledges the interest in mature and old-growth (MOG) forests by directing U.S. Federal agencies to define and inventory these resources on United States Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. We propose using an effective and enduring mature forest classification system that could be adaptable to social paradigms, monitoring data streams, scientific information, and global change factors. We accommodate these design aspects by defining mature forests as a growth stage prior to the onset of old-growth attributes within a proposed Forest Inventory Growth Stage System (FIGSS). FIGSS uses the long-established USFS old-growth assessments often conducted in concert with public dialogues to identify key structural indicators of older forests. The system informs inverse modeling of the prior “mature” stage’s structural thresholds enabling initial population estimates of mature forest extent using the USFS’ nationally consistent Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program data. With this approach, we estimate that approximately 45 percent of all USFS/BLM forest is mature. The FIGSS system is based on a variety of components that could be used to account for cultural values ascribed to forest conditions which could be refined across future versions such as assumptions about the relative length of growth stages, incorporating data from emerging monitoring technologies along with old-growth/mature field sampling campaigns, accommodating spectrums of site-limited and/or disturbance-driven stand development, refined variable selection processes such as machine-learning, and consideration of traditional ecological knowledge.

                  In recent years, urban flood disasters caused by sudden heavy rains have become increasingly severe, posing a serious threat to urban public infrastructure and the life and property safety of residents. Rapid simulation and prediction of urban rain-flood events can provide timely decision-making reference for urban flood control and disaster reduction. The complex and arduous calibration process of urban rain-flood models has been identified as a major obstacle affecting the efficiency and accuracy of simulation and prediction. This study proposes a multi-scale urban rain-flood model rapid construction method framework, BK-SWMM, focusing on urban rain-flood model parameters and based on the basic architecture of Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The framework comprises two main components: 1) constructing a SWMM uncertainty parameter sample crowdsourcing dataset and coupling Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and K-means clustering machine learning algorithm to discover clustering patterns of SWMM model uncertainty parameters in urban functional areas; 2) coupling BIC and K-means with SWMM model to form BK-SWMM flood simulation framework. The applicability of the proposed framework is validated by modeling three different spatial scales in the study regions based on observed rainfall-runoff data. The research findings indicate that the distribution pattern of uncertainty parameters, such as depression storage, surface Manning coefficient, infiltration rate, and attenuation coefficient. The distribution patterns of these seven parameters in urban functional zones indicate that the values are highest in the Industrial and Commercial Areas (ICA), followed by Residential Areas (RA), and lowest in Public Areas (PA).

However, when the study area's geographical scale expands, the simulation's accuracy will decline. Further research is required on the scale dependency of urban storm flood models.

Assessing health risks associated with blood PFOA levels is challenging because exposure guidance values (EGVs) are typically expressed in terms of external dose. Biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) consistent with EGVs could facilitate health-based interpretations. Objective To i) derive BEs for serum/plasma PFOA corresponding to non-cancer EGVs of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Health Canada, and ii) compare with PFOA concentrations from national biomonitoring surveys. Methods Starting from EGV points of departure, we employed pharmacokinetic data/models and uncertainty factors. Points of departure in pregnant rodents (U.S. EPA 2016, ATSDR) were converted into fetus and pup serum concentrations using an animal gestation/lactation pharmacokinetic model, and equivalent human fetus and child concentrations were converted into BEs in maternal serum using a human gestation/lactation model. The point of departure in adult rodents (Health Canada) was converted into a BE using experimental data. For epidemiology-based EGVs (U.S. EPA 2023, draft), BEs were directly based on epidemiological data or derived using a human gestation/lactation pharmacokinetic model. BEs were compared with Canadian/U.S. biomonitoring data. Results Non-cancer BEs (ng/mL) were 684 (Health Canada, 2018) or ranged from 15 to 29 (U.S. EPA, 2016), 6–10 (ATSDR, 2021) and 0.2–0.8 (U.S. EPA, 2023, draft). Ninety-fifth percentiles of serum levels from the 2018–2019 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were slightly below the BE for ATSDR, and geometric means were above the non-cancer BEs for the U.S. EPA (2023, draft). Conclusion Non-cancer BEs spanned three orders of magnitude. The lowest BEs were for EGVs based on developmental endpoints in epidemiological studies. Concentrations in Canadian/U.S. national surveys were higher than or close to BEs for the most recent non-cancer EGVs."

With the ubiquitous use of social media and the prosperous developments in machine and deep learning, it has become feasible to collect and process massive amounts of information produced by online communities about their perceptions of heritage as social constructs. Moreover, such information is usually inter-connected and embedded within specific socioeconomic and spatiotemporal contexts. This paper presents a methodological workflow for using semi-supervised learning with graph neural networks (GNN) to classify, summarize, and map cultural significance categories based on user-generated content on social media. Several GNN models were trained as an ensemble to incorporate the multi-modal (visual and textual) features and the contextual (temporal, spatial, and social) connections of social media data in an attributed multi-graph structure. The classification results with different models were aligned and evaluated with the prediction confidence and agreement. Furthermore, message diffusion methods on graphs were proposed to aggregate the post labels onto their adjacent spatial nodes, which helps to map the cultural significance categories in their geographical contexts. The workflow is tested on data gathered from Venice as a case study, demonstrating the generation of social perception maps for this UNESCO World Heritage property. This research framework could also be applied in other cities worldwide, contributing to more socially inclusive heritage management processes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds the potential of diffusing any human-generated location-based information onto spatial networks and temporal timelines, which could be beneficial for measuring the safety, vitality, and/or popularity of urban spaces."

                  Few studies have effectively analysed the spatial patterns of urban smellscapes, public perception, exposure risks, or design an inclusive decision-support system. The current study coupled multiple methods to measure, map, and compare notable smell emitting spots, associated air quality indices, and public perception in Kano, Nigeria. It has revealed how urban informal activities generate both pleasant and offensive smells that contaminate the air more than the city's transportation and manufacturing. Notably, the most perceived odour hotspots coupled with highly hazardous sites with AQI value of >1200 which were found around the city's main abattoir. Conversely, the most commonly distributed pleasant smell spots are beef and chicken grills whose charcoal burning generate hazardous air quality. The novelty of this study includes its ability to use empirical data to design an inclusive decision support tool that identifies pathways for individuals, vulnerable groups, policymakers, and civil society groups to respond to various exposure risks. The study has identified informality, urban spatial inequalities, densification, and poor spatial planning which appeared to be the key drivers of the observed clustering of pleasant/unpleasant smellscapes juxtaposing with sites of worst air quality.

                  Background
                  Currently, health care is expert-centric, especially with regard to decision-making. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) or interconnected electronic health records (EHRs) suffer from low adoption rates. In the rare cases of technically successful implementation, they often result in inefficient or error-prone processes.
               
                  Aim & Methods
                  This paper explores the state of the art in AI-based digital decision support systems (DDSSs). To overcome the low adoption rates, we propose a systematic strategy for bringing DDSS research into clinical practice based on a design science approach. DDSSs can transform health care to be more innovative, patient-centric, accurate and efficient. We contribute by providing a framework for the successful development, evaluation and analysis of systems for AI-based decision-making. This framework is then evaluated using focus group interviews.
               
                  Results
                  Centred around our framework, we define a systematic approach for the use of AI in health care. Our systematic AI support approach highlights essential perspectives on DDSSs for systematic development and analysis. The aim is to develop and promote robust and optimal practices for clinical investigation and evaluation of DDSS in order to encourage their adoption rates. The framework contains the following dimensions: disease, data, technology, user groups, validation, decision and maturity.
               
                  Conclusion
                  DDSSs focusing on only one framework dimension are generally not successful; therefore, we propose to consider each framework dimension during analysis, design, implementation and evaluation so as to raise the number of DDSSs used in clinical practice.
               
                  Public Interest Summary
                  The digital transformation of the healthcare sector creates the potential for the sector to be more accurate, efficient and patient-centric using AI, or so-called digital decision support systems. In this research, we explore why these systems are needed and how they can be successfully implemented in clinical practice. For this, we propose a systematic approach based on our conceptual framework. Against this background, we present our vision for further advancing these technologies. We see our systematic AI support as a primary driver, with the possibility to facilitate the much-needed breakthrough of decision support systems in health care.

To address this knowledge gap, we developed an innovative monitoring approach for quantitative assessment of combined sewer overflow (CSO) impacts on the bacteriology of receiving rivers. Our approach combines conventional and environmental DNA (eDNA) based methods to generate multiple lines of evidence for assessing risks to public health. We demonstrated this approach by investigating spatiotemporal variation in the bacteriology of the Ouseburn in northeast England for different weather conditions in the summer and early autumn of the year 2021 across eight sampling locations that comprised rural, urban, and recreational land use settings. We characterized pollution source attributes by collecting sewage from treatment works and CSO discharge at the peak of a storm event. CSO discharge was characterized by log10 values per 100 mL (average ± stdev) of 5.12 ± 0.03 and 4.90 ± 0.03 for faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, and 6.00 ± 0.11 and 7.78 ± 0.04 for rodA and HF183 genetic markers, for E. coli and human host associated Bacteroides, respectively, indicating about 5 % sewage content. SourceTracker analysis of sequencing data attributed 72–77 % of bacteria in the downstream section of the river during a storm event to CSO discharge sources, versus only 4–6 % to rural upstream sources. Data from sixteen summer sampling events in a public park exceeded various guideline values for recreational water quality. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) predicted a median and 95th percentile risk of 0.03 and 0.39, respectively, of contracting a bacterial gastrointestinal disease when wading and splashing around in the Ouseburn. We show clearly why microbial water quality should be monitored where rivers flow through public parks, irrespective of their bathing water designation."

                  Air pollution is one of the most serious environmental issues faced by humans, and it affects the quality of life in cities. PM2.5 forecasting models can be used to create strategies for assessing and warning the public about anticipated harmful levels of air pollution. Accurate pollutant concentration measurements and forecasting are critical criteria for assessing air quality and are the foundation for making the right strategic decisions. Data-driven machine learning models for PM2.5 forecasting have gained attention in the recent past. In this study, PM2.5 prediction for Hyderabad city was carried out using various machine learning models viz. Multi-Linear Regression (MLR), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. A deep learning model, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, was also used in this study. The results obtained were finally compared based on error and R2 value. The best model was selected based on its maximum R2 value and minimal error. The model's performance was further improved using the randomized search CV hyperparameter optimization technique. Spatio-temporal air quality analysis was initially conducted, and it was found that the average winter PM2.5 concentrations were 68% higher than the concentrations in summer. The analysis revealed that XGBoost regression was the best-performing machine learning model with an R2 value of 0.82 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.01 μg/ m3, whereas the LSTM deep learning model performed better than XGBoost regression for PM2.5 modeling with an R2 value of 0.89 and an MAE of 5.78 μg/ m3.

                  Previous studies indicate that natural and built environment factors significantly influence health outcomes in older adults. However, most cross-sectional studies exploring the impact of these factors on health fail to quantify the relative importance of each factor. Here, we use the XGBoost machine learning technique with SHAPley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to rank the importance of built environment factors, natural environmental factors, and sociodemographic factors in shaping older adults’ odds of good self-rated health (SRH), in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, China. To address self-selection bias in housing choice, older adults living in private housing, who have more freedom to choose residential locations, were distinguished from those living in public or self-built housing. To better interpret the results of XGBoost outcomes and analyse the association between factors and SRH, we used SHAP dependence plots. Results show that both built environment and natural environment factors play important roles in predicting SRH. Four built environment factors (accessibility to public transit stations, points of interest density, road density, and population density) and two natural environment factors (air quality index and surrounding greenness) have considerable predictive power for SRH for both groups. Among these factors, accessibility to public transit stations, road density, and air quality index become less important after controlling for self-selection bias. We also trace potential threshold effects of residential greenness, points of interest density, and road density on decreasing older adults' SRH within certain intervals after controlling for self-selection bias. Findings from this study can support the decision-making of policymakers regarding urban planning, landscape design, and environmental management to improve overall health of older adults.

However, safety-related data on CBD in the public domain are limited, including a lack of quality studies evaluating its genotoxic potential. The quality of available studies is limited due to the test material used (e.g., low CBD purity) and/or study design, leading some global regulatory agencies to highlight genotoxicity as an important data gap for CBD. To address this gap, the genotoxic potential of a pure CBD isolate was investigated in a battery of three genotoxicity assays conducted according to OECD testing guidelines. In an in vitro microbial reverse mutation assay, CBD up to 5000 μg/plate was negative in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537, and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA, with and without metabolic activation. Testing in an in vitro micronucleus assay was negative in human TK6 cells up to 10–11 μg/mL, with and without metabolic activation. Finally, an in vivo micronucleus assay conducted in male and female rats was negative for genotoxicity up to 1000 mg/kg-bw/d. Bioanalysis of CBD and its primary metabolite, 7-carboxy CBD, confirmed a dose-related increase in plasma exposure. Together, these assays indicate that CBD is unlikely to pose a genotoxic hazard."

                  Transportation activity recognition (TAR) provides valuable support for intelligent transportation applications, such as urban transportation planning, driving behavior analysis, and traffic prediction. There are many advantages of movable sensor-based TAR, and the key challenge is to capture salient features from segmented data for representing diverse patterns of activity. Although existing methods based on statistical information are efficient, they usually rely on domain knowledge to construct high-quality features manually. Likewise, the methods based on spatial-temporal relationships achieve good performance but fail to extract statistical features. The features extracted by these two methods have proven to be crucial for the classification of activity. How to combine them to acquire a more robust representation remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a novel parallel model named Distributional and Spatial-Temporal Robust Representation (DSTRR), which combines automatic learning of statistical, spatial, and temporal features into a unified framework. This model leads to three optimized subnets and thus obtains a robust representation specific to TAR. Extensive experiments performed on three public datasets show that DSTRR is a state-of-the-art method compared with the baseline methods. The results of ablation study and visualization not only demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in DSTRR, but also show the model remains robust to a wide range of parameter variations.

                  Electric scooters (e-scooters) are becoming one of the most popular micromobility options in the United States. Although there is some evidence of increased mobility, reduced carbon emissions, replaced car trips, and associated public health benefits, there is little known about the patterns of e-scooter use. This study proposes a framework for high-resolution analysis of micromobility data based on temporal, spatial, and weather attributes. As a case study, we scrutinized more than one million e-scooter trips of Nashville, Tennessee, from September 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019. Weather data and land use data from the Nashville Travel Demand Model and scraping of Google Maps Point of Interest (POI) data complemented the trip data. The combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a K-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm identified five distinct e-scooter usage patterns, namely morning work/school, daytime short errand, social, nighttime entertainment district, and utilitarian trips.
                  Among other findings, the most common use of e-scooters in Nashville was daytime short errand trips, contributing to 29% of all e-scooter trips. We found that 7% of all e-scooter trips resembled morning commuting to work or school. Only 16% of trips were classified as Nighttime Entertainment District trips. The average daily number of trips on a typical weekend was 81% higher than a typical weekday. We also found variation in e-scooter usage patterns over a year with high summer ridership patterns. The findings of this study can help city administrations, planners, and micromobility operators to understand when and where people are using e-scooters. Such knowledge can guide them in making data-driven decisions regarding safety, sustainability, and mode substitution of emerging micromobility.

                  Short-term wind speed predication is of great significance for scholars (e.g., understanding wind profiles), practitioners (e.g., building energy management), regulators (e.g., urban microclimate regulation), and even the general public. Current wind speed forecasting methods either generate sparse predictions or occur high cost. This paper reports a novel, inexpensive framework to forecast urban local dense wind speed. The central tenet is a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and LSTM combinatorial deep learning model to learn the features of input historical weather image series coupled with spatial-temporal correlations. The model was trained and tested using Hong Kong datasets. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified and compared with parallel models under different criteria, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2). The experimental results show that: (1) the proposed ConvLSTM-LSTM deep learning model can effectively forecast wind speed regardless of location; (2) the overall MAE, RMSE, and R2 value of the proposed model are improved by 14.84%, 15.04%, and 7.51%, respectively, compared to the ConvLSTM-full connected (ConvLSTM-FC) model, and by 22.12%, 22.80%, and 12.24%, respectively, compared to the convolutional neural network-LSTM (CNN-LSTM) model; and (3) compared with parallel models, the proposed model has better performance in predicting wind speed series with large amplitude variations and rapid frequency changes.

The study focused on the automated identification of defects in existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) bridges exploiting different Deep Learning (DL) approaches and techniques to interpret the obtained predictions. Ensuring the safety of infrastructures is typically a technical and economic issue. Still, in the case of the engineering infrastructure heritage, there are existing bridges and viaducts with a high historical, cultural, and symbolic value. For them, accurate knowledge and characterization of possible degradation processes become particularly important in order to define intervention strategies that combine safety and conservation requirements. With the aim to develop systematic and non-invasive investigation protocols for continuous and effective control of defects and their evolution, a database of existing RC bridge defect images was collected, and the most recurrent defect typologies were classified by domain experts. Some existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) algorithms were applied to the dataset for automatically recognizing all defects, but the specific novel contribution of the research work is the interpretation of the obtained results in a form that is humanly explainable and directly implementable in new tools for bridge inspections. To interpret the results, Class Activation Maps (CAMs) approaches were employed within available eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, which allow to observe the activation zones and nearly perfectly highlight the type of specific defect in a given image. The obtained results, besides suggesting which network works better than others and if the specific defect is effectively recognized, have been evaluated through a quasi-quantitative procedure that compared a qualitative assessment of the CNNs models reliability with two novel indexes representing new explaining metrics of the obtained results. In the end, the outcomes of the proposed study were observed also in a real-life case study. The proposed discussion opens new scenarios in the application of these techniques for supporting road management companies and public organizations in the evaluation of the road networks health state."

However, there are still relatively few case studies that describe the current state of defining these quality requirements in practice. Objective This study consisted of two phases. The first goal of our study was to explore what ethical guidelines organizations have defined for the development of transparent and explainable AI systems and then we investigated how explainability requirements can be defined in practice. Methods In the first phase, we analyzed the ethical guidelines in 16 organizations representing different industries and public sector. Then, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the results of the first phase with practitioners. Results The analysis of the ethical guidelines revealed that the importance of transparency is highlighted by almost all of the organizations and explainability is considered as an integral part of transparency. To support the definition of explainability requirements, we propose a model of explainability components for identifying explainability needs and a template for representing explainability requirements. The paper also describes the lessons we learned from applying the model and the template in practice. Contribution For researchers, this paper provides insights into what organizations consider important in the transparency and, in particular, explainability of AI systems. For practitioners, this study suggests a systematic and structured way to define explainability requirements of AI systems. Furthermore, the results emphasize a set of good practices that help to define the explainability of AI systems."

                  A growing body of literature shows that despite the significant benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), its adoption has many unknowns and challenges. However, theoretical studies dominate this topic. Completing the recent works, this article aims to identify challenges faced by public organizations when adopting AI based on the PRISMA Framework and an empirical assessment of these challenges in the opinion of public managers using survey research. The adopted research procedure is also an added value because it could be replicated in other context scenarios. To achieve this paper's aim, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and survey research among authorities in 414 Polish cities were carried out. As a result, a list of 15 challenges and preventive activities proposed by researchers to prevent these challenges have been identified. Empirical verification of identified challenges allows us to determine which of them limit AI adoption to the greatest extent in public managers' opinion. These include a lack of strategy or plans to initial adoption / continued usage of AI; no ensuring that AI is used in line with human values; employees' insufficient knowledge of how to use AI; insufficient AI policies, laws, and regulations; and different expectations of stakeholders and partners about AI. These findings could help practitioners to prioritize AI adoption activities and add value to digital government theory.

                  This research aimed to conduct Spatio-temporal modeling of people's olfactory perception in the Tehran city using a machine learning-based approach considering the importance of people's perception of the urban environment and the effect of the sense of smell in strengthening or weakening the environmental and urban spaces. Therefore, a spatial database containing dependent and independent data was established to model and prepare a potential map of people's olfactory perception in Tehran. The dependent data were collected through a questionnaire among 687 people, which contains three states of sense of smell, including neutral (350 cases), pleasant (247 cases), and unpleasant (90 cases). The independent data consisted of distance to public transport stations, livestock and poultry production centers, streets, fuel stations, fruit and vegetable fields, restaurants, industrial areas, garbage volume, traffic volume, population density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), meteorological data (wind speed and direction, and humidity), and air quality index (AQI). The last three criteria were provided temporarily in four seasons. A random forest (RF) algorithm was utilized to model and prepare the potential map of people's olfactory perception in four seasons. Generally, 70% of the information was dedicated to modeling, and the remained 30% was applied for validation. Results of the Gini index revealed the more significant impact of the criteria of distance from fruit and vegetable fields and distance from restaurants in neutral smells, distance from streets and distance from restaurants in pleasant smells, and distance from livestock and poultry production centers and garbage volume in unpleasant smells among spatial criteria. One of the essential spatial-temporal criteria was wind direction in all seasons for neutral smells, in summer, fall, and winter for pleasant smells, and in fall for unpleasant smells. The RF algorithm modeling results indicated the greater effect of distance to public transport stations in spring, garbage volume in summer and winter, and population density in autumn on the sense of smell. The potential maps of olfactory perception were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). AUC values were calculated for the spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons as much as 0.956, 0.955, 0.957, and 0.958 for neutral, 0.944, 0.928, 0.946, and 0.942 for pleasant, and 0.922, 0.931, 0.963, and 0.981 for unpleasant states, respectively. The potential maps of this study help present a more pleasant olfactory space to urban users by urban planners and managers.

                  Conventional sidewalk studies focused on quantitative analysis of sidewalk walkability at a large scale which cannot capture the dynamic interactions between the environment and individual factors. Embracing the idea of Tech for Social Good, Urban Digital Twins seek AI-empowered approaches to bridge humans with digitally-mediated technologies to enhance their prediction ability. We employ GraphSAGE-LSTM, a geo-spatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) framework on crowdsourced data and computer vision to predict human comfort on the sidewalks. Conceptualising the pedestrians and their interactions with surrounding built and unbuilt environments as human-centric dynamic graphs, our model captures such spatio-temporal variations given by the sequential movements of human walking, enabling the GraphSAGE-LSTM to be spatio-temporal-explicit. Our experiments suggest that the proposed model provides higher accuracy by more than 20% than a traditional machine learning model and two state-of-art deep learning frameworks, thus, enhancing the prediction power of Urban Digital Twin. The source code for the model is shared openly on GitHub.

First, we propose a bilevel optimization problem that allows estimating the demand using historical data and the observed bus frequencies. This model has been applied to small theoretical networks and the transit network of Tandil (a medium-sized city in Buenos Aires, Argentina), showing good results. However, from a practical point of view, the computation time of the algorithm used to solve the bilevel problem is long, reducing its applicability by traffic authorities. To solve this, we propose to use an artificial neural network module that allows to quickly detect if the change in demand is significant enough (for example, beyond a predefined threshold). If it is substantial, the operator can decide to run the algorithm to estimate the demand and take action to adapt the system to the new reality, for example, adapting vehicle frequencies or incorporating more vehicles into the system so that the current demand can be served. The machine learning approach allows it to be used as a fast change detection tool, avoiding running the expensive algorithm for false positives."

                  Current studies have quantified landscape value based on the quantity of social media, ignoring public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. Our objective is to quantify and map landscape value by developing a novel intelligent landscape value evaluation method based on online texts. We argue that online texts can be converted into quantities through deep learning technology, which allows the measurement of public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. We selected perception frequency, perception heat, perception preference and the value index as indicators to quantify landscape value, which is the product of perception heat and perception preference. We collected more than 14,000 online texts about the Orange Islands in Changsha city from 2010 to 2020, analysed the perception heat using Python to extract data, and analysed the perception preference using Baidu API sentiment analysis technology. The results show that the novel method has a wide range of data sources and represents the real public perception and value orientation, demonstrating that online texts with a wealth of mined information can be used to evaluate landscape value. The model calculating the landscape value overcomes the shortcomings of current methods that ignore public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. The results also show that the conservation mode of Orange Island is successful, and the conservation method suggested by the recommendation on the historic urban landscape is feasible. The study highlights the contribution of public preferences to landscape value and provides insight into the situations and variations of value types on Orange Island. The novel method is highly intelligent, time-saving, has low labour costs, and is applicable and can be applied to the evaluation of landscape value, especially in cases where value conflicts exist.

                  This study aims to evaluate the economic growth of coal-resource-oriented cities under Low-Carbon (LC) economic growth. The public participation mechanisms are promoted, and the vitality of the economic market of resource-oriented cities is enhanced by increasing the intervention of government policies. Firstly, the context of the coal-resource-oriented cities and LC economy are analysed. Secondly, an economic resilience assessment system for coal-resource-oriented cities is established, characterized by traditional and high-tech industries through the analysis of the condition of resource-oriented cities. Finally, in the process of optimizing and managing the economic structure, the assessment of the LC evolution path of resource-oriented cities is strengthened through the extensive participation of the general public. The results show that the economic resilience level of coal-resource-oriented and traditional cities fluctuates and increases from 2011 to 2021. In 2011, the economic resilience index of traditional cities and coal-resource-oriented cities was 0.11and 0.22. By 2021, traditional cities’ and coal-resource-oriented cities’ economic resilience assessment stability was 0.527 and 0.562. This study has pivotal reference value for promoting urban resource management and economic efficiency.

                  The presence of anthropogenic infrastructure within the ground under cities can act to increase the temperature of the subsurface in a phenomenon known as the subsurface urban heat island effect. Large city-scale numerical subsurface temperature models accounting for both the heat fluxes stemming from human-made structures as well as hydrogeological variation are often computationally prohibitive due to the vastly different scales of modelling required. We present a novel and scalable methodology for the determination of the subsurface thermal climate beneath urban centres at a holistic scale, grouping volumes of ground into archetypes according to common thermal behaviours, identified using supervised machine learning algorithms. We apply this methodology to two boroughs in the centre of London, UK, with the results showing good agreement with a higher-resolution model for one of the boroughs. We further demonstrate the scalability of the approach by modelling the boroughs sequentially, where the second borough was modelled at little to no additional computation cost at a loss of accuracy in the local depth-averaged temperature between 0.10 and 0.23 degrees Celsius.

                  Current advancement in satellite sensor and remote sensing image (RSI) technologies allows high-resolution RSI, which provide spatial information about the world. In these circumstances, RSI scene classification is attracted considerable interest owing to its wide-ranging applications like environmental monitoring, urban planning, national defence security, and natural hazard detection. New deep learning (DL) achievements have resulted in the newest technology of RSISC applications; however, they lack trustworthiness and explainability. But RSIs of sensitive area is vulnerable to theft, interception, and loss due to the transmission through public channel or the storage in the cloud environment. Therefore, this study develops a mayfly optimization with deep learning (DL) based robust remote sensing scene image classification (MFODL-RRSSIC) model. The presented MFODL-RRSSIC model majorly aims to accomplish two objectives namely scene classification and security. For scene classification, the presented MFODL-RRSSIC technique employs NasNet feature extraction, MFO based hyperparameter tuning, and stacked autoencoder (SAE) classifier. Besides, the presented MFODL-RRSSIC model exploits modified deep belief network (MDBN) for intrusion detection and attaining security. A wide-ranging simulation analysis is made on popular datasets to illustrate the enhanced performance of the MFODL-RRSSIC technique.

                  With the emergence of the sharing economy and the rapid growth of mobile communications technologies, many novel sharing service models have been developed stemming from ride-hailing. Urban traffic congestion, coupled with energy conservation and emissions reduction, has prompted research on enhancing vehicle seat utilization in taxi service. To offer more effective and reliable ride-hailing, we consider ride-sharing problem with passenger transfer that allows passegers to transfer between vehicles at transfer stations. The problem requires simultaneous addressing the issues of request dispatching, transfer scheduling, and vehicle rebalancing. Studying such a ride-hailing model, we propose a novel joint decision framework combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with integer-linear programming (ILP) to solve the problem. We use ILP to obtain the optimal online dispatching and matching strategy in each decision stage, and DRL to learn the approximate state value of each vehicle that incorporates with some strategies to limit the state space and reduce the computational complexity. Performing numerical studies on the real-world trip dataset in Chengdu, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, and that ride-sharing with passenger transfer is more beneficial than traditional ride-sharing.

                  Public comments are a rich source of data on attitudes toward public policy, but the scale poses major challenges for qualitative analyses. Supervised deep learning and natural language processing potentially enable classification of these data but require high quality labeled inputs. This study investigates whether hybridizing rigorous qualitative coding methods with machine learning approaches can classify large amounts of policy-oriented text data (public comments) while keeping manual effort tractable. Using a convolutional neural network, we evaluate spatiotemporal variation in themes and expressed public attitudes toward a specific US climate policy, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was proposed in 2014 and repealed in 2019 without ever taking effect. Public comments were solicited for both the proposal and proposed repeal across eight cities, representing a large and highly targeted dataset on dynamic public attitudes toward the CPP. Rigorous manual coding and data augmentation techniques enabled good model performance (F1 scores of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively, for sentiment and topic classification), even with a very small training set. We find that most speakers supported the CPP despite its eventual repeal and uncover notable rhetorical trends like competing narratives of justice for those affected by climate change versus fossil fuel host communities.

                  While environmental criminology suggests that crime and the urban environment are closely related, some studies suggest a nonlinear relationship. This study analyzed the relationship between crime incidence and the urban environment using urban big data such as points-of-interest (POI), smart civil complaint data, and street image data from Naver Street View in Seoul, Korea. For analysis, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method have been used. The analysis results confirmed a nonlinear relationship comprising inflection points between crime incidence and the urban environment. Also, this study identified the interaction effects of urban environmental variables on crime incidence. Finally, the hierarchical clustering method was used to identify the contributions of various aspects of the urban environments to crime incidence. Then, this study provides policy implications to prevent potential criminal activities and promote public safety for sustainable cities and societies.

                  With the rise of sharing economy, bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have gained heated attention, and their operations require accurate prediction of bike usage. Although many deep learning methods have been exploited to predict bike usage, they generally provide point predictions of average bike usage, neglecting the stochasticity in BSSs. Due to the analytically explainable properties and linear computational costs with respect to data size, neural processes (NPs) have recently attracted increasing interest. An NP model learns a Gaussian process (GP) by mapping the input–output observations to a probabilistic distribution over functions. Each function is a distribution of the outputs given an input, conditioned on the arbitrary size of observed data. NPs provide probabilistic confidence in predicted results, which overcomes the point prediction issue faced by other models and provides insights for operational strategies in stochastic scenarios. This paper originally proposes a transformer-encoder-based NP (TENP) model to fit the distribution of bike usage in BSSs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to incorporate transformer encoders into NPs, enhancing the capability of extracting relevant information in a targeted manner. Based on the Citi Bike datasets in New York City, the TENP method is adopted in a multi-task learning task that simultaneously fits the number of pickups and returns. The proposed TENP model outperforms the conventional NP method and its extensions and prevalent machine learning models in terms of prediction accuracy. Armed with the probabilistic confidence provided by the TENP, reliability analysis is conducted, and thoughtful guidance is provided for bike-sharing operations, such as dynamic bike rebalancing.

                  This study aims at predicting the concentrations of particulate matter in container ports. Meteorological data, terminal operation data, and data on PM2.5 and PM10 and other air pollutants at container ports were collected from Gwangyang Port in South Korea. A prediction model was developed using neural network methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and multivariate linear regression (MLR). This study revealed that performance of LSTM was the highest. In addition, the performance of models with operating data is higher than the models without operating data as they have lower error values and stable decreasing patterns in a loss curve for training and validation loss. The proposed model could be used to provide PM information in advance to port workers and the public living in port cities so they can respond with personal hygiene and workplace health protection measures according to the predicted amount of PM.

                  The Analog Identification Methodology (AIM) was developed over 20 years ago to identify analogues to support read-across at the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, the current public version of the standalone tool, released in 2012, is no longer usable on Windows operating systems supported by Microsoft. Additionally, the structural logic for analogue selection is based on older, customised Simplified molecular-input-line-entry system (SMILES)-type features that are incompatible with modern cheminformatics tools. Given these limitations, a case study was undertaken to explore a more transparent, extensible method of implementing the AIM fragments using Chemical Subgraphs and Reactions Mark-up Language (CSRML). A CSRML file was developed to codify the original AIM fragments, and the extent to which AIM fragments were faithfully replicated was assessed using the AIM Database. The overall mean performance of the CSRML-AIM across all fragments in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and Jaccard similarity was 89.5%, 99.9%, and 82.2%, respectively. Comparing the AIM fragments with public ToxPrints using a large set of ∼25,000 substances of regulatory interest to EPA found them to be dissimilar, with an average maximum Jaccard score of 0.24 for AIM and 0.29 for ToxPrint fingerprints. Both fragment sets were then used as inputs in the automated read-across approach, Generalised Read-Across (GenRA), to evaluate the quality of fit in predicting rat acute oral toxicity LD50 values with the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The performance of AIM fragments was R2=0.434 and RMSE=0.663 whereas that of ToxPrints was R2=0.477 and RMSE=0.638. A bootstrap resampling using 100 iterations found the mean and the 95th confidence interval of R2 to be 0.349 [0.319, 0.379] for AIM fragments and 0.377 [0.338, 0.412] for ToxPrints. Although AIM and ToxPrints performed similarly in predicting LD50, they differed in their performance at a local level, revealing that their features can offer complementary insights.

The implementation of wastewater based surveillance (WBS) could reduce the burden on the public health system, management of pandemics, help to make informed decisions, and protect public health. In this study, a house with COVID-19 patients was targeted for monitoring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers in wastewater samples (WS) with clinical specimens (CS) for a period of 30 days. RT-qPCR technique was employed to target nonstructural (ORF1ab) and structural-nucleocapsid (N) protein genes of SARS-CoV-2, according to a validated experimental protocol. Physiological, environmental, and biological parameters were also measured following the American Public Health Association (APHA) standard protocols. SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in wastewater peaked when the highest number of COVID-19 cases were clinically diagnosed. Throughout the study period, 7450 to 23,000 gene copies/1000 mL were detected, where we identified 47 % (57/120) positive samples from WS and 35 % (128/360) from CS. When the COVID-19 patient number was the lowest (2), the highest CT value (39.4; i.e., lowest copy number) was identified from WS. On the other hand, when the COVID-19 patients were the highest (6), the lowest CT value (25.2 i.e., highest copy numbers) was obtained from WS. An advance signal of increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load from the COVID-19 patient was found in WS earlier than in the CS. Using customized primer sets in a traditional PCR approach, we confirmed that all SARS-CoV-2 variants identified in both CS and WS were Delta variants (B.1.617.2). To our knowledge, this is the first follow-up study to determine a temporal relationship between COVID-19 patients and their discharge of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genetic markers in wastewater from a single house including all family members for clinical sampling from a developing country (Bangladesh), where a proper sewage system is lacking. The salient findings of the study indicate that monitoring the genetic markers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater could identify COVID-19 cases, which reduces the burden on the public health system during COVID-19 pandemics."

One promising way to mitigate its impacts is to develop a real-time flood risk management system; however, building such a system is often challenging due to the lack of high spatiotemporal rainfall data. While some approaches (i.e., ground rainfall stations or radar and satellite techniques) are available to measure and/or predict rainfall intensity, it is difficult to obtain accurate rainfall data with a desirable spatiotemporal resolution using these methods. This paper proposes an image-based deep learning model to estimate urban rainfall intensity with high spatial and temporal resolution. More specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model called the image-based rainfall CNN (irCNN) model is developed using rainfall images collected from existing dense sensors (i.e., smart phones or transportation cameras) and their corresponding measured rainfall intensity values. The trained irCNN model is subsequently employed to efficiently estimate rainfall intensity based on the sensors’ rainfall images. Synthetic rainfall data and real rainfall images are respectively utilized to explore the irCNN’s accuracy in theoretically and practically simulating rainfall intensity. The results show that the irCNN model provides rainfall estimates with a mean absolute percentage error ranging between 13.5% and 21.9%, which exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art modeling techniques in the literature. More importantly, the main feature of the proposed irCNN is its low cost in efficiently acquiring high spatiotemporal urban rainfall data. The irCNN model provides a promising alternative for estimating urban rainfall intensity, which can greatly facilitate the development of urban flood risk management in a real-time manner."

                  A resilient city includes multiple energy carriers, high-efficiency infrastructure, lower resource demand to decarbonize and sustain the urban system in accordance with the Paris Agreement, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the various recovery plans following the COVID-19 pandemic period. To achieve these goals, a key role is played by all urban sectors, which can reduce environmental impacts and accelerate the green transition at larger scale. Intervening on a district scale obviously requires the evaluation of different aspects, taking into account both economic and non-economic criteria, as well as different points of view, involving all stakeholders. This paper proposes a multi-step evaluation procedure that extends the European manual-based Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to include the extra-economic benefits and the stakeholders’ opinion in the evaluation, according to the COmpoSIte Model for Assessment (COSIMA) method. This is the first application of COSIMA in the urban design sectors (i.e. buildings, water, public lighting, transportation and waste management) where different sustainable measures for a real case study located in Turin (Italy) were compared to define the most suitable transformation scenario according to multiple criteria. The results have shown how invasive scenarios allow achieving the greatest benefits, despite the huge initial costs of realization.

Particularly in China, no public dataset of fake financial news is available. This paper focuses on Chinese financial market and constructs a unique dataset from clarification announcements targeting for financial news with Internet sources. Besides content features and contextual features, financial features are typically added to the feature set due to unique characteristics of financial news. Based on our sample, a deep learning approach is proposed to detect fake financial news, which demonstrates superior performance to several other baseline models, with accuracy of 94.38% and f1-score of 87.67%.The ablation experiment indicates that content features contained in the article itself contribute strongly to detect fake financial news. Finally, Shapley value is used to explain the characteristics of fake financial news compared with real ones in Chinese financial market."

This study aimed to construct a machine learning model predicting the maximum care-needs level required for long-term care within the next three years for persons aged over 75 years. Methods The prediction model was constructed using features extracted from long-term care and healthcare insurance claims data. The study subjects were a total of 47,862 elderly individuals who had not received long-term care services in a large city in Japan. The prediction classes for outcome variable were categorized according to the criteria of the Japanese long-term care system: class 0 (no required), class 1 (support levels 1 and 2), class 2 (care levels 1 and 2), and class 3 (care levels 3–5). As explanatory variables, a total of 516 features were used, including age, sex, and 514 diseases classified under ICD-10. In this study, we focused on constructing a prediction model with the interpretability and adopted multinomial logistic regression (MLR) with L2 regularization as a machine learning algorithm. MLR allowed us to identify the characteristics influencing each prediction class of care-needs levels. Results In terms of overall predictive performance, MLR achieved weighted average precision, recall, F-value, and lift scores of 0.694, 0.505, 0.567, and 1.333, respectively. Compared to other machine learning algorithms, MLR demonstrated comparable performance to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). From the factor analysis based on the magnitudes of coefficients of the MLR model, the top three features influencing each prediction class were as follows: class1: female sex, hypertension, and gonarthrosis; class 2: age, Alzheimer-type dementia, and neuromuscular dysfunction of the bladder; class 3: age, Alzheimer-type dementia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Conclusions In practical terms, the care-needs level prediction can be applied by local governments to identify high-risk areas by comprehensively and routinely predicting insured persons under public health insurance and long-term care insurance systems."

                  Planners and policymakers have been quick to open electronic channels of participation to inform decision-making processes due to the low cost and high potential engagement. This has created an opportunity for subversive groups to amplify their voice, and therefore influence, in land development and planning processes using automated social media accounts. While scholars have begun to examine how social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been used to manipulate political discourse, no research has considered the potential damage that such manipulation can and does cause in the local planning context. This study examines the role and potential risk of automated social media accounts in the participatory planning process through an empirical investigation of 21 real estate development projects in the U.S. Using a machine learning model to assess 41,191 relevant Tweets, we found that at least 10% and upwards of 50% of Tweets concerning the various real estate development projects were generated by bots. Automated tweets included critical, neutral, and supportive content demonstrating that social bots represent a range of interests. Planning and public policy professionals will need to develop, apply, and be aware of bot-detection tools and actively promote and build trust through their own digital channels to ensure accurate information is disseminated.

                  Ground-level ozone is an important pollutant regarding air quality and climate. Mexico City frequently experiences severe ozone episodes due to a combination of strong ozone precursor emissions and its specific topographical environment which critically impacts meteorological conditions. High ozone levels during these episodes cause harmful effects to the public health and the environment. This necessitates ranking air quality and meteorological variables according to their contributions towards the build-up of ozone. In this study, three machine learning models are used to learn a prediction function with hourly data of eight predictors as input and hourly ground-level ozone mixing ratios as output. One-year hourly data of eight predictors collected in Mexico-City from March 2015 to February 2016 is employed to train and test the models. The best model, capturing ozone peak levels with 92% accuracy during 6–18 March 2016, is used to rank the predictors according to their importance in the build-up of ozone applying a shapley additive explanations approach based on the game theory shapley values. This 6–18 March 2016 period encompassed different meteorological and emission conditions and included a severe ozone smog episode from 12 to 17 March 2016. Such ranking of the air quality and meteorological variables is crucial for policy-making decisions regarding the prevention and mitigation of ozone detrimental effects during severe ozone episodes and provides insight into the functional dependency of ozone on its predictors. The proposed approach showcases Mexico City, but its principles can be applied for ozone episodes at any other location.

                  Traffic forecasting is crucial to achieving a smart city as it facilitates public transportation management, autonomous driving, and the resource relocation of the sharing economy. Traffic forecasting belongs to the challenging spatiotemporal forecasting task, which is highly demanding because of the complicated geospatial correlation between traffic nodes, inconsistent and highly non-linear temporal patterns due to various events, and sporadic traffic accidents. Previous graph neural network (GNN) models built for transportation forecasting feature the sophisticated structure and heavy computation cost as they combine the deep neural network and graph machine learning to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics for the whole transportation network. However, it may be more practical for practitioners to perform node-wise forecasting for specific nodes of interest rather than network-wise forecasting. To mitigate the gaps mentioned above, we propose a novel graph ensemble deep random vector functional link network (GEdRVFL) to forecast the future traffic volume by combining the well-performing ensemble deep random vector functional link (EdRVFL) with the graph convolution layer for a specific node and realize the node-wise traffic forecasting. After a comprehensive comparison with the state-of-the-art models, our model beats the others in four out of five cases measured by mean absolute scaled error.

                  The large amount of data generated during the COVID-19 pandemic requires advanced tools for the long-term prediction of risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality with higher accuracy. Machine learning (ML) methods directly address this topic and are essential tools to guide public health interventions. Here, we used ML to investigate the importance of demographic and clinical variables on COVID-19 mortality. We also analyzed how comorbidity networks are structured according to age groups. We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 mortality with hospitalized patients from Londrina, Parana, Brazil, registered in the database for severe acute respiratory infections (SIVEP-Gripe), from January 2021 to February 2022. We tested four ML models to predict the COVID-19 outcome: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost. We also constructed a comorbidity network to investigate the impact of co-occurring comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality. Our study comprised 8358 hospitalized patients, of whom 2792 (33.40%) died. The XGBoost model achieved excellent performance (ROC-AUC = 0.90). Both permutation method and SHAP values highlighted the importance of age, ventilatory support status, and intensive care unit admission as key features in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. The comorbidity networks for old deceased patients are denser than those for young patients. In addition, the co-occurrence of heart disease and diabetes may be the most important combination to predict COVID-19 mortality, regardless of age and sex. This work presents a valuable combination of machine learning and comorbidity network analysis to predict COVID-19 outcomes. Reliable evidence on this topic is crucial for guiding the post-pandemic response and assisting in COVID-19 care planning and provision.

                  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic due to the rapid and worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To prevent spread of the infection social contact restrictions were enacted worldwide, which suggest a significant effect on the anthropogenic emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants in urban areas. To account for the influence of meteorological conditions on airborne pollutant concentrations, we used a Random Forest machine learning technique for predicting business as usual (BAU) pollutant concentrations of NO2 and PM10 at five observation sites in the city of Berlin, Germany, during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown periods. The predictor variables were based on meteorological and traffic data from the period of 2017–2019. The differences between BAU and observed concentrations were used to quantify lockdown-related effects on average pollutant concentrations as well as spatial variation between individual observation sites. The comparison between predicted and observed concentrations documented good overall model performance for different evaluation periods, but better performance for NO2 (R2 = 0.72) than PM10 concentrations (R2 = 0.35). The average decrease of NO2 was 21.9% in the spring lockdown and 22.3% in the winter lockdown in 2020. PM10 concentrations showed a smaller decrease, with an average of 12.8% in the spring as well as the winter lockdown. The model results were found sensitive to depict local variation of pollutant reductions at the different sites that were mainly related to locally varying modifications in traffic intensity.

                  Due to the difficulties of data collection in some cities and the relatively small portion of more severe crashes, this paper proposes a cost-sensitive transfer learning framework for more robust crash severity analysis. Specifically, to address the class imbalance issue, cost-sensitive learning method is adopted by assigning unequal cost values to different crash severity levels to obtain unbiased classification results. Moreover, due to the existence of city-irrelevant common crash contributing factors, cross-city crash severity analysis is developed, i.e., transferring common crash severity knowledge from other cities with transfer learning algorithm to assist crash severity modelling in target city that suffers from data scarcity problem. In this study, the crash datasets of Victorian Australia and Seattle are selected as the target and source domains respectively. To address the issue of heterogeneous explanatory features among these two datasets and extract the interpretable common crash severity knowledge, a feature alignment approach is proposed which can represent the cross-city data with unified feature representations on their original explanatory feature spaces. The two proposed models, i.e., cost-sensitive transfer logistic regression (CST-LR) and cost-sensitive transfer support vector machine (CST-SVM), have demonstrated better performance in comparison with twelve commonly used crash severity models, especially when target city crash data is scarce. The most significant crash contributing factors extracted by proposed model also show higher degree of consistency with the true contributing factors obtained from the target dataset, in comparison with the model built without transfer learning. The results could provide policy implications and counter measures for crash severity mitigation.

                  The past decade has witnessed a significant growth of electric vehicles (EVs) deployment in public and private transportation sectors. Dynamic electric vehicle routing aims to plan the routes of EVs to serve dynamically generated customers’ requests while ensuring the battery level by visiting the recharge stations. This paper studies the dynamic electric vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery and soft time windows (DEVRP-STW). We design a graph-based spatio-temporal multi-agent reinforcement learning (GMIX) framework consisting of a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) and a value decomposition-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (Graph-QMIX). Graph-QMIX derives a multi-agent soft policy gradient based on QMIX and Soft Actor–Critic and utilises a graph-based mixing network proposed to enhance the interaction of agents. Extensive experiments including a case study using real-world taxi data from New York City and a simulation study are conducted. The proposed GMIX outperforms the baseline algorithms on the request–response ratio (RRO), the average travelling distance per completed request (ATR), the out of energy ratio (OER) and the average waiting time per completed request (AWR).

Previous studies demonstrated the potential of using multispectral satellite imagery for classifying tree species. However, methods that can map tree species in mixed forest stands on a large scale are lacking. We propose an innovative method for mapping the proportions of tree species using Sentinel-2 imagery. A convolutional neural network was used to quantify the per-pixel basal area proportions of tree species considering the neighbouring environment (spectral–spatial deep learning). A nested U-shaped neural network (UNet++) architecture was implemented. We produced a map of the entire Wallonia Region (southern Belgium). Nine species or groups of species were considered: Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, Douglas fir, Pine genus, Poplar genus, Larch genus, Birch genus, and remaining species. The training dataset for the convolutional neural network model was prepared using a map of forest parcels extracted from the public forest administration’s geodatabase of Wallonia. The accuracy of the predicted map covering the region was independently assessed using data from the regional forest inventory of Wallonia. A robust assessment method for tree species proportions maps was proposed for assessing the (1) majority species, (2) species composition (presence or absence), and (3) species proportions (proportion values). The achieved value of indicator OA m a j (0.73) shows that our approach can map the majority tree species in mixed and pure forest stands. Indicators MS (0.89), MPS (0.72) and MUS (0.83) support that the model can predict the species composition in most cases in the study area. Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, and Douglas fir achieved the best results, with PAs and UAs close to or higher than 0.70. Particularly, high performance was achieved for detecting Oak genus and Beech in low area proportions: PAs and UAs higher than 0.70 from the 0.4 proportion. Predicted proportions had a R a d j 2 of 0.50. The proposed method, which uses spectral–spatial deep learning to map the proportions of tree species, is innovative because it was adapted to the complexity of mixed forests and spatial resolution of current satellite imagery. Additionally, it optimises the use of available forest data in the model conception by considering all pixels from pure stands to highly mixed forest stands. When forest inventories are available in a broad sense, that is, georeferenced areas with the proportions of tree species, this method is highly reproducible and applicable at a large scale, offering potential for use in forest management."

The method was realized in a near real time (NRT) application which allows for the processing of data from different satellites and modes. The algorithm estimates the total significant wave height H s , dominant and secondary swell and windsea wave heights, first, and second moment wave periods, the mean wave period and the period of wind sea. The algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW), Extra Wide (EW) and Wave Mode (WV) Level-1 (L1) products and also extended to X-band TerraSAR-X (TS-X) StripMap (SM) products. The scenes are processed in raster and result in continuous sea state fields, with the exception of S1 WV, where averaged values for sea state parameters for along-orbit imagettes of 20 km × 20 km are presented. The developed empirical algorithm consists of two parts: a first CWAVE_EX (extended CWAVE) part, based on a linear regression approach, and a subsequent machine learning part using the support vector machine (SVM) technique. A series of new data preparation steps (i.e. filtering, denoising) and new features estimated from SAR images are also introduced. The algorithm was tuned and validated using two independent global wave model hindcasts, WaveWatch-3 and MFWAM as well as National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements. The achieved root mean squared errors (RMSE) for CWAVE_EX for the total H s are 0.60 m for low-resolution modes S1 IW (10 m pixel) and EW (40 m pixel) and 0.35 m for S1 WV and TS-X SM (pixel spacing ca.1–4 m) in comparison to model predictions. The RMSEs of the retrieved wave periods are in the range of 0.45–0.90 s for all of the satellites and models considered. Similarly, the dominant and secondary swell, and wind sea wave height RMSEs are in the range of 0.35–0.80 m. The SVM postprocessing improves the accuracy of the initial results of CWAVE_EX for H s and reaches an RMSE of 0.25 m for S1 WV. Comparisons to 64 NDBC buoys, collocated at distances shorter than 50 km to S1 WV imagettes worldwide, result in an RMSE of 0.41 m. All results and the methods presented are novel in terms of the accuracy achieved, combining the classical approach with machine learning techniques, and performing an automatic NRT processing of multiparametric sea state fields from L1 data with automatic switching for different satellites and modes. The complete archive of S1 WV L1 Single Look Complex products from December 2014 until February 2021 was processed to create a sea state parameter database and validated using model hindcast and buoy measurements. The derived parameters are available to the public within the scope of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative."

                  Accurate PM2.5 concentration prediction can provide reliable air pollution warning information to the public. However, previous studies have often focused on the data of the target city itself, ignoring the interaction among cities in the same region. In this paper, we develop a multi-scale ensemble learning approach to forecast daily PM2.5 concentrations of the target city by modeling its air and climate indicators, and PM2.5 value of its neighboring cities. First, the proposed approach smooths the multivariate data by singular spectrum analysis and performs multi-feature selection based on distance factor and predictive power of data. Second, the inherent association among the obtained multiple features is captured by multivariate empirical modal decomposition. Third, the Hurst exponent is applied to match each time scale with the corresponding predictor for multi-step prediction. Finally, the forecasting values of all time scales are summed to obtain the PM2.5 concentration forecasting results of the target city. Four experiments involving Beijing, Wuhan, and Shenzhen are carried out to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all benchmark models, and introducing city synergy strategy can improve the forecasting performance significantly.

                  Urbanization, accompanied by the creation of roads, pavements, and sidewalks creates an environment where there is limited infiltration capacity, leaving metropolitan areas especially vulnerable during intense rain events. Furthermore, within an urban setting, there is spatial variability, as certain areas, owing to location, topography, land feature conditions, population and physical attributes or precipitation patterns, are more prone to flood damages. To detect neighborhoods with increased flood risk, crowdsourced data, which is the consolidation of eyewitness accounts, affords particular value. With an intent to understand how factors affect the spatial variability of street flooding, the Random Forest regression machine learning algorithm is employed, where the 311 street flooding reports of New York City (NYC) serve as the response, while the explanatory variables include topographic and land feature, physical and population dynamics, locational, infrastructural, and climatic influences. This study also analyzes socio-economic variables as predictors, as to allow for better insight into potential biases within the NYC 311 crowdsourced platform. It is found that catch basin complaints have overwhelmingly the greatest predictor importance, at 41%, almost sixfold higher than that of the second highest ranked predictor, slope, at 6.7%. Thus, NYC has an apparent issue with debris blocking the basins, and this may be remediated by increased cleaning efforts or public awareness to maintain clear streets, particularly during forecasted rain events. Furthermore, more than a third of the top predictors are land feature and topographical conditions, with building characteristics dominating the category. Often excluded in urban flood models, building effects, with a combined total importance of 11.7%, have greater significance than commonly considered flooding factors, such as percent impervious cover or elevation. Another major finding is the significance of the ‘commuters who drive alone’ variable, which alerts to the prospect of more reports being filed by those more affected by street flooding, as opposed to reflecting the actual occurrence of flooding (more reports being filed by those who drive on flooded roads versus those who do not). Overall, the leading contribution of this study is the identification of the top flooding factors in NYC, along with the presentation of their specific impacts towards street flooding variability among zip codes.

                  Public agencies have a strong interest in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, many public agencies lack tools and frameworks to articulate a viable business model and evaluate public value as they consider investing in AI systems. The business model canvas used extensively in the private sector offers us a foundation for designing a public AI canvas (PAIC). Employing a design science approach, this study reports on the design and evaluation of PAIC. The PAIC comprises three distinctive layers: (1) the public value-oriented AI-enablement layer; (2) the public value logic layer; and (3) the public value-oriented social guidance layer. PAIC offers guidance on innovating the business models of public agencies to create and capture AI-enabled value. For practitioners, PAIC presents a validated tool to guide AI deployment in public agencies.

Yet, the use of AI in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. Prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of AI has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of AI technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of AI, particularly in public organizations. Building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop AI capabilities. To answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in Europe about factors that influence their development of AI capabilities. We collected data from 91 municipalities from three European countries (i.e., Germany, Norway, and Finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that five factors – i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support – have an impact on the development of AI capabilities. We also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of AI solutions are not important determinants of AI capability formation. Our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of AI supporting managers in public organizations to develop AI capabilities."

                  Urban land-use planning decisions generally require negotiation between multiple stakeholders to reach an agreement on a specific plan. Computer-aided tools such as group decision support systems can facilitate the actors in this complicated process. In the context of these systems, using software agents enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of group decision support. The software agents can perform some computational and analytical tasks on behalf of the stakeholders. In more advanced cases, the agents can also learn stakeholders’ preferences and behavior to help them make good decisions. This paper proposes an intelligent web-based spatial group decision support system to investigate the role of opponents modeling in urban land use planning by using a multi-agent system approach. For this purpose, two successive meetings are held in which the system is used: in the first meeting, the stakeholders revise the existing plans and respond to other stakeholders’ requests. During the meeting, software agents attempt to model the behavior of the stakeholders they are associated with, based on a Bayesian learning method in combination with social value orientation theory to describe stakeholders’ decision behavior in a group context. In the second meeting, the software agents help the stakeholders in the step of plan revision by providing the information obtained to the stakeholders. In an application, a comparison of the results of the meetings showed that the provided information about the opponents reduced the negotiation time and contributed to reaching a better spatial configuration of land-uses based on a criterion provided by social value orientation theory.

As a result, spatial information is often not used effectively. This paper uses image-based neural networks to explore the relationship between urban spatial risk and the distribution of infected populations, and the design of urban facilities. To achieve this objective, we use spatio-temporal data of people infected with new coronary pneumonia prior to 28 February 2020 in Wuhan. We then use kriging, which is a method of spatial interpolation, as well as core density estimation technology to establish the epidemic heat distribution on fine grid units. We further evaluate the influence of nine major spatial risk factors, including the distribution of agencies, hospitals, park squares, sports fields, banks and hotels, by testing them for significant positive correlation with the distribution of the epidemic. The weights of these spatial risk factors are used for training Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models, which predict the distribution of cases in a given area. The input image for the machine learning model is a city plan converted by public infrastructures, and the output image is a map of urban spatial risk factors in the given area. The results of the trained model demonstrate that optimising the relevant point of interests (POI) in urban areas to effectively control potential risk factors can aid in managing the epidemic and preventing it from dispersing further."

                  Updated cadastral land values are a matter of critical importance for local governments: higher revenue of property taxes, more equitable treatment to taxpayers, a fundamental input in the design of public policies related to access to land and housing for the most vulnerable and a key feature in land value capture strategies to finance public infrastructure, to name just a few public policies that require correct valuations of land. However, in Latin America, outdated cadastral values are common to most cities. The reasons for this can be found in the complexity of the mass appraisal process, lack of institutional and fiscal capacity to undertake it and bureaucratic resistance to its implementation.
                  The objective of this paper is to present a mass appraisal methodology that uses only free and open data to achieve robust urban land valuations. Information from the OpenStreetMap Project is used to generate several land variables. In addition, the Global Human Settlement Layer of the European Commission is used to determine the level of consolidation of urban sprawl. Land value data were obtained from the Mapa de Valores de América Latina, a collaborative initiative that systemizes more than 68,000 data from more than 900 cities.
                  This information is used to train three tree-based machine learning models: Random Forest, Quantile Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Model. The results support the viability of the proposed strategy, simplifying the mass appraisal process in terms of costs, time and complexity of the information used.

Likewise, cities are interested in improving responsiveness to citizens’ demands and cost savings through data analytics. However, city managers face many challenges when utilizing secondary data, such as 311 call records and the US Census. The challenge of interest to the current study is boundary issues as a result of data being collected at divergent geographic levels over different time horizons. Accordingly, an inductive analytical methodology was developed to create units of analysis that were both pragmatically and analytically appropriate for city managers and local policymakers. We created an open data analytics framework called OpenComm to harmonize administrative and secondary data using administrative data derived from Kansas City, Missouri. This framework produced robust inferences regarding the spatial and temporal aspects for the communities. Privacy-preserving technology, in particular, has been applied to public data to protect community privacy. The findings illustrate the power of inductive data aggregation, leading to empirical insights into hidden patterns of city service disparity over a decade-long time horizon.

                  China’s unprecedented urbanisation in the last several decades has significantly transformed its urban built environment. On the one hand, such an urbanisation has brought about improvement in infrastructure, access to various public facilities, and opportunities for social connectivity, all of which would benefit citizen’s wellbeing. On the other hand, rapid, unplanned, and unregulated urbanisation may lead to air pollution and water pollution, compact neighbourhoods, traffic noise and congestion, and lack of natural amenity, which pose various threats to urban dwellers’ wellbeing and life satisfaction. Therefore, how to build liveable cities has become one of the key goals and top priorities of urban planning in China and other developing countries. This study investigates the effect of urban greenness and mixed land-use, two key dimensions defining urban liveability, on residents’ life satisfaction at both residence and workplace settings in Beijing. Three big geo-coded datasets are combined, including a social survey about residents’ subjective life satisfaction and demographic characteristics, eye-sensored street greenness data extracted from online platform through machine learning, and fine-grain land-use data based on point-of-interest entropy, and then taken into a Bayesian multilevel ordered logit model. The empirical results reveal that (1) street view greenness could enhance life satisfaction at residence, but depress life satisfaction at workplace; (2) mixed land-use could positively contribute to life satisfaction at both residence and workplace; and (3) there exist positive interactions between greenness and mixed land-use. These empirical findings provide practical implications for planning and constructing liveable cities in China and other countries where both urban greening and mixed land-use are promoted and embraced as core elements of the compact city and smart city ideal.

                  Clarification basins are ubiquitous water treatment units applied across urban water systems. Diverse applications include stormwater systems, stabilization lagoons, equalization, storage and green infrastructure. Residence time (RT), surface overflow rate (SOR) and the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) are readily implemented but are not formulated to optimize basin geometrics because transport dynamics remain unresolved. As a result, basin design yields high costs from hundreds of thousands to tens of million USD. Basin optimization and retrofits can benefit from more robust and efficient tools. More advanced methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), while demonstrating benefits for resolving transport, can be complex and computationally expensive for routine applications. To provide stakeholders with an efficient and robust tool, this study develops a novel optimization framework for basin geometrics with machine learning (ML). This framework (1) leverages high-performance computing (HPC) and the predictive capability of CFD to provide artificial neural network (ANN) development and (2) integrates a trained ANN model with a hybrid evolutionary-gradient-based optimization algorithm through the ANN automatic differentiation (AD) functionality. ANN model results for particulate matter (PM) clarification demonstrate high predictive capability with a coefficient of determination (

                     ). The proposed framework was implemented for a basin and watershed loading conditions in Florida (USA), the ML basin designs yield substantially improved cost-effectiveness compared to common designs (square and circular basins) and RT-based design for all PSDs tested. To meet a presumptive regulatory criteria of 80% PM separation (widely adopted in the USA), the ML framework yields 4.7X to 8X lower cost than the common basin designs tested. Compared to the RT-based design, the ML design yields 5.6X to 83.5X cost reduction as a function of the finer, medium, and coarser PSDs. Furthermore, the proposed framework benefits from ANN’s high computational efficiency. Optimization of basin geometrics is performed in minutes on a laptop using the framework. The framework is a promising adjuvant tool for cost-effective and sustainable basin implementation across urban water systems.

In this study, we present a machine learning approach applied to forecasts of the day-ahead maximum value of ozone concentration for several geographical locations in southern Switzerland. Due to the low density of measurement stations and to the complex orography of the use-case terrain, we adopted feature selection methods instead of explicitly restricting relevant features to a neighborhood of the prediction sites, as common in spatio-temporal forecasting methods. We then used Shapley values to assess the explainability of the learned models in terms of feature importance and feature interactions in relation to ozone predictions. Our analysis suggests that the trained models effectively learned explanatory cross-dependencies among atmospheric variables. Finally, we show how weighting observations helps to increase the accuracy of the forecasts for specific ranges of ozone’s daily peak values."

Despite a wealth of likely benefits that have made their eventual launch inescapable, CAVs may also be a source of unprecedented disruption for tomorrow's travel eco-systems because of their vulnerability to cyber-threats, hacking and misinformation. CAVs manipulated by users, traffic controllers or third parties may act in deceitful ways. This scene-setting work introduces the deceitful CAV, a vehicle that operates in a deceitful manner towards routing and control functionality for ‘selfish’ or malicious purposes and contextualises its diverse expressions and dimensions. It specifically offers a systematic taxonomy of eight distinctive deceitful behaviours namely: suppression/camouflage, overloading, mistake, substitution, target conditioning, repackaging capability signatures, amplification and reinforcing impression. These as exemplified by their most common attack forms (i.e., starvation, denial-of-service, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, poisoning, masquerading, flooding and spoofing) are then benchmarked against five key dimensions referring to time frame (short to long duration), engagement (localised to systemic), urban traffic controller infrastructure (single to multiple components), scale (low to high), and impact (low to high). We then suggest mitigation strategies to protect CAV technology against these dangers. These span from purely technological measures referring to the machine-centric triad of vehicles, communication, and control system including adversarial training, heuristic decision algorithms and weighted voting mechanisms to human factor measures that focus on education, training, awareness enhancement, licensing and legislation initiatives that will enable users and controllers to prevent, control or report deceitful activities."

                  The ease of access to the internet has sparked a worldwide interest in SM in recent years. The possibilities for the use of SM as a potential source in improving the management of disasters are increasing. Although there is an existing research ongoing with the analysis of the usage of SM during disasters, but none of the works have exploited the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for the validation of the transparency of the ML models. The contribution of this research is two-fold: Firstly, ML based time series analysis for relief operations using social media information with situational information gathered using Twitter from the users and resource providers and secondly, XAI has been used to increase the transparency and understand-ability of model decisions. For the case study, public dataset from Nepal, Italy earthquakes, COVID-19 dataset along with originally collected Twitter dataset has been considered. The performance of the extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) model is relatively superior than other techniques with 10-fold training mean accuracy of 87.17%. Thus, the experiments conclude the possibility of automation for the time series analysis for optimal relief operation management to serve the victims in the most efficient way and to control legal and administration implications.

                  Activities Recognition (AR) and Occupancy Estimation (OE) are vital to many smart systems that work on providing good services in smart buildings. Many applications, such as energy management need information like activities and occupancy to provide good assistance. Most of the previous research about AR and OE focused on applying supervised machine learning methods. Researchers train a model and evaluate it using data collected from the same environment (Domain). A model trained in a specific domain will not generalize well in other domains. Creating a trained model to every environment is not feasible due to the lack of data. Collecting sufficient data can be time consuming and infeasible in some cases. Computational power can be a challenge for researchers by increasing the training time due to the lack of the required computing resources. Using traditional machine learning methods, the obtained performance may be unsatisfactory, and can not lead to optimal solutions. For all these reasons, we need a solution that helps us overcome the stated problem and obtain models with acceptable results. In this work, we present and discuss different transfer learning methods that help us transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. The goal is to reuse as much as possible information from the source domain to enhance the performance of the model at the target domain. This type of approaches will solve the problems mentioned before such as the lack of data and will provide us with good results due to the use of knowledge from multiple source domains. We tested five Transfer learning (TL) approaches: a principal component analysis (PCA)-like method that creates a transformation like the PCA transformation and apply it to the data to create new common domain, a PCA based method that creates common domain using PCA, a PCA-SMOTE method that balances the data and creates common domain, a basic method based on a simple matching between similar features from source and target domain, and a sparse coding-based method that creates a common domain where the data representation will be as sparse as possible. The impressive results that we obtained in both tasks prove that the presented methods can be applied to transfer knowledge across different domains.

                  Many countries around the globe have imposed several response measures to suppress the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning of 2020. These measures have impacted routine daily activities, along with their impact on economy, education, social and recreational activities, and domestic and international travels. Intuitively, the different imposed policies and measures have indirect impacts on urban traffic mobility. As a result of those imposed measures and policies, urban traffic flows have changed. However, those impacts are neither measured nor quantified. Therefore, estimating the impact of these combined yet different policies and measures on urban traffic flows is a challenging task. This paper demonstrates the development of an artificial neural networks (ANN) model which correlates the impact of the imposed response measure and other factors on urban traffic flows. The results show that the adopted ANN model is capable of mapping the complex relationship between traffic flows and the response measures with a high level of accuracy and good performance. The predicted values are closed to the observed ones. They are clustered around the regression line, with a coefficient of determination (

                     ) of 0.9761. Furthermore, the developed model can be generalized to determine the anticipated demand levels resulted from imposing any of the response measures in the post-pandemic era. This model can be used to manage traffic during mega-events. It can be also utilized for disaster or emergency situations, where traffic flow estimates are highly required for operational and planning purposes.

                  The emergence of various types of everyday urban problems poses severe challenges to the conventional top-down designed urban problem-handling protocols. Social sensing data, such as the urban problem complaint hotline records, constitute good sources for collecting bottom-up information on urban problems. Nevertheless, a partially obsolete urban problem categorization standard, a manually operated and experience-dependent workflow for problem classification and pushing, and an unoptimized problem-handling responsibility designation among the municipal departments have been impairing the sufficient utilization of the collected complaint data toward more efficient urban problem-handling performance. In this paper, based on the 12345-hotline data collected in Sanya City, China, we 1) construct an urban problem tree that presents a new and expandable classification of everyday urban problems with 7 super-types, 34 types, and 105 sub-types of events, thus complementing that in the existing National Standard which merely contains 6 types and 66 sub-types; 2) design an auto-classification algorithm for the complaint records with Natural Language Processing and Supervised Machine Learning methods, which achieves an accuracy of up to 75% at the super-type level; and 3) optimize the urban problem-handling responsibility designation among the municipal departments for improved departmental function distinction and balanced workloads, which combined with the auto-classification algorithm yield a decrease of the problem pushing failure ratio from the current 73.8% to 14.6%. We integrate all the above functions in a web-based information system to establish a digital platform for practical urban problem-handling. We conclude the paper with discussions on the paper's implications of an overhaul of urban legislative and executive systems following a bottom-up paradigm and reflections on the paper's limitations and theoretical implications from a complex-system theory perspective.

                  PM2.5 pollution endangers human health and urban sustainable development. Land use regression (LUR) is one of the most important methods to reveal the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5, and the introduction of characteristic variables of geographical factors and the improvement of model construction methods are important research directions for its optimization. However, the complex non-linear correlation between PM2.5 and influencing indicators is always unrecognized by the traditional regression model. The two-dimensional landscape pattern index is difficult to reflect the real information of the surface, and the research accuracy cannot meet the requirements. As such, a novel integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern index (TDLPI) and machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST) improved LUR model (LTX) are developed to estimate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the fine particle concentration in Shaanxi, China, and health risks of exposure and inhalation of PM2.5 were explored. The LTX model performed well with R2 = 0.88, RMSE of 8.73 μg/m3 and MAE of 5.85 μg/m3. Our findings suggest that integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern information and XGBOOST approaches can accurately estimate annual and seasonal variations of PM2.5 pollution The Guanzhong Plain and northern Shaanxi always feature high PM2.5 values, which exhibit similar distribution trends to those of the observed PM2.5 pollution. This study demonstrated the outstanding performance of the LTX model, which outperforms most models in past researches. On the whole, LTX approach is reliable and can improve the accuracy of pollutant concentration prediction. The health risks of human exposure to fine particles are relatively high in winter. Central part is a high health risk area, while northern area is low. Our study provides a new method for atmospheric pollutants assessing, which is important for LUR model optimization, high-precision PM2.5 pollution prediction and landscape pattern planning. These results can also contribute to human health exposure risks and future epidemiological studies of air pollution.

Due to the high population density, poor hygiene, chaotic waste discharge, and inadequate public facilities, urban villages have many negative impacts on both urban environment and management. The objective of this study is to propose a dual-branch deep learning model for multi-modal satellite and street-view data fusion to detect urban villages in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, which are the core cities of Jing-Jin-Ji region of China. Specifically, the proposed model consists of a satellite branch, a street-view branch and a gated-fusion module. As for the satellite branch, a Trans-MDCNN (multi-scale dilated convolutional neural network) is proposed to learn multi-level local features and global contextual features from high resolution satellite imagery, while for the street-view branch, an MVRAN (multi-view recurrent attention network) is constructed to learn and fuse multi-angle features from street-view images. A gated-fusion module is designed to aggregate the important features of the dual-branches. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model has achieved good performance with an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.61%. Ablation study shows that compared with satellite data alone, the integration of street-view images could increase the OA by about 2%. Besides, 1-D feature fusion outperforms its 2-D counterpart and the classic feature concatenation method. The proposed model also yields a better performance than other deep learning models.

                  Background
                  Since January 2020, India has faced two waves of COVID-19; preparation for the upcoming waves is the primary challenge for public health sectors and governments. Therefore, it is important to forecast future cumulative confirmed cases to plan and implement control measures effectively.
               
                  Methods
                  This study proposed a hybrid autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Prophet model to predict daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases. The built-in auto.arima function was first used to select the optimal hyperparameter values of the ARIMA model. Then, the modified ARIMA model was used to find the best fit between the test and forecast data to find the best model parameter combinations. Articles, blog posts, and news stories from virologists, scientists, and health experts related to the third wave of COVID-19 were gathered using the Python web scraping package Beautiful Soup. Their opinions (sentiments) toward the potential third wave were analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) libraries.
               
                  Results
                  A spike in daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases was predicted in India in the next 180 days based on past time series data. The results were validated using various analytical tools and evaluation metrics, producing a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.06. The NLP processing results revealed negative sentiments in most articles and blogs, with few exceptions.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The findings of this study suggest that there will be more active cases in the upcoming days. The proposed models can forecast future daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases. This study will help the country and states plan appropriate public health measures for the upcoming waves of COVID-19.

                  Traffic congestion and accidents take a toll on commuters' daily experiences and society. Locating the venues prone to congestion and accidents and capturing their perception by public members is invaluable for transport policy-makers. However, few previous methods consider user perception toward the accidents and congestion in finding and profiling the accident- and congestion-prone areas, leaving decision-makers unaware of the subsequent behavior responses and priorities of retrofitting measures. This study develops a framework to identify and characterize the accident- and congestion-prone areas heatedly discussed on social media. First, we use natural language processing and deep learning to detect the accident- and congestion-relevant Chinese microblogs posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Then a modified Kernel Density Estimation method considering the sentiment of microblogs is employed to find the accident- and congestion-prone regions. The results show that the 'congestion-prone areas' discussed on social media are mainly distributed throughout the historical urban core and the Northwest of Pudong New Area, in reasonably good agreements with actual congestion records. In contrast, the 'accident-prone areas' are primarily found in locations with severe accidents. Finally, the above venues are characterized in spatio-temporal and semantic aspects to understand the nature of the incidents and assess the priority level for mitigation measures. The outcomes can provide a reference for traffic authorities to inform resource allocation and prioritize mitigation measures in future traffic management.

                  Air pollution is the existence of atmospheric chemicals damaging the health of human beings and other living organisms or damaging the environment or resources. Rarely any common contaminants are smog, nicotine, mold, yeast, biogas, or carbon dioxide. The paper will primarily observe, visualize and anticipate pollution levels. In particular, three algorithms of Artificial Intelligence were used to create good forecasting models and a predictive AQI model for 4 distinct gases: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and atmospheric particulate matter. Thus, in this paper, the Air Qualification Index is developed utilizing Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree GBDT Ensembles model over the next 5 h and analyzes air qualities using various sensors. The hypothesized artificial intelligence models are evaluated to the Root Mean Squares Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean absolute error, depending upon the performance measurements and a lower error value model is chosen. Based on the algorithm of the Artificial Intelligent System, the level of 5 air pollutants like CO2, SO2, NO2, PM 2.5 and PM10 can be predicted immediately by integrating the observations with errors. It may be used to detect air quality from distance in large cities and can assist lower the degree of environmental pollution.

                  Green space, especially visual contact with greenery, is an important aspect of space quality assessment and has a significant impact on the premium of real estate. Due to the limitations in available data and technologies, existing hedonic studies mainly capture accessibility to green space (i.e., proximity), and how visual contact with green space (i.e., visibility) impacts housing prices is not well understood. This paper measures the intangible concept of visual contact with green space by taking advantage of street view images and community photos based on semantic segmentation. Then, based on hedonic model theory, a set of housing price determinants is selected. Finally, we construct two models, namely, random forest regression and geographically weighted regression models, to explore the capitalization effects of visual contact with green space on housing prices in Shenzhen, China. In our study, compared with indicators such as park accessibility and greening rate, variables of green visual contact are more important for housing prices. Moreover, the effects of visual contact with green space inside and outside the community display marked spatial variations. This work is a beneficial attempt to focus on the human scale for the actual demand of urban green planning. The findings of this paper add further knowledge to highlight the importance of visual contact with green space in street design and urban planning, which can enrich research on the amenity values of green space and the quality of public space theoretically and methodologically.

                  Traditional centralized water-management systems have tended to fall short in delivering environmental and amenity benefits in urban areas. Water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) projects have been proposed as an alternative due to their ability to generate multiple benefits, including improving water quality, water supply, aesthetics, urban cooling, spaces for recreation, and habitat for biodiversity. However, in most cities, investment in such systems has been relatively low, in part due to the difficulty of monetizing the multifunctional benefits of WSUD projects and including them in comprehensive economic analyses. We describe the development, testing and application of INFFEWS (Investment Framework For the Economics of Water Sensitive cities), an economic decision-support system for investment in WSUD projects. INFFEWS is based on a Benefit: Cost Analysis (BCA) framework and is consistent with standard BCA. A prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary-equivalent values of intangible (non-market) benefits from WSUD projects. Development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users, review of existing tools, and primary research over eight years (2013–2020). The frameworks can be applied to business-case development and decision making at multiple levels in public-sector and private-sector organisations.

                  Air quality profoundly impacts public health and environmental equity. Efficient and inexpensive air quality monitoring instruments could be greatly beneficial for human health and air pollution control. This study proposes an image-based deep learning model (CNN−RC) that integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a regression classifier (RC) to estimate air quality at areas of interest through feature extraction from photos and feature classification into air quality levels. The models were trained and tested on datasets with different combinations of the current image, the baseline image, and HSV (hue, saturation, value) statistics for increasing model reliability and estimation accuracy. A total of 3549 hourly air quality datasets (including photos, PM2.5, PM10, and the air quality index (AQI)) collected at the Linyuan air quality monitoring station of Kaohsiung City in Taiwan constituted the case study. The main breakthrough of this study is to timely produce an accurate image-based estimation of several pollutants simultaneously by using only one single deep learning model. The test results show that estimation accuracy in terms of R2 for PM2.5, PM10, and AQI based on daytime (nighttime) images reaches 76% (83%), 84% (84%), and 76% (74%), respectively, which demonstrates the great capability of our method. The proposed model offers a promising solution for rapid and reliable multi-pollutant estimation and classification based solely on captured images. This readily scalable measurement approach could address major gaps between air quality data acquired from expensive instruments worldwide.

Individual decision behavior about whether or not to be vaccinated plays an important role in achieving adequate vaccination coverage and herd immunity. Methods This research proposes a new susceptible–vaccinated–exposed–infected–recovered with awareness-information (SEIR/V-AI) model to study the interaction between vaccination and information dissemination. Information creation rate and information sensitivity are introduced to understand the individual decision behavior of COVID-19 vaccination. We then analyze the dynamical evolution of the system and validate the analysis by numerical simulation. Results The decision behavior of COVID-19 vaccination in China and the United States are analyzed. The results showed the coefficient of information creation and the information sensitivity affect vaccination behavior of individuals. Conclusions The information-driven vaccination is an effective way to curb the COVID-19 spreading. Besides, to solve vaccine hesitancy and free-ride, the government needs to disseminate accurate information about vaccines safety to alleviate public concerns, and provide the widespread public educational campaigns and communication to guide individuals to act in group interests rather than self-interest and reduce the temptation to free-riding, which often results from individuals who are inadequately informed about vaccines and thus blindly imitate free-riding behavior."

                  The study investigated the potential relationships between air pollution, socio-economy, and proven pathologies (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular) within an industrial area in Southern France (Etang de Berre), gathering steel industries, oil refineries, shipping, road traffic and experiencing a Mediterranean climate. A total of 178 variables were simultaneously integrated within a Bayesian model at intra-urban scale. Various unsupervised and supervised algorithms (maximum spanning tree, tree-augmented naive classifier) as well as sensitivity analyses were used to better understand the links between all variables, and highlighted correlations between population exposure to air pollutants and some pathologies. Adverse health effects (bronchus and lung cancers for 15–65 years old people) were observed for hydrofluoric acid at low background concentration (<0.003 μg m−3) while exposure to particulate cadmium (0.210–0.250 μg m−3) disrupts insulin metabolism for people over 65 years-old leading to diabetes. Bronchus and lung cancers for people over 65 years-old occurred at low background SO2 concentration (6 μg m−3) below European limit values. When benzo[k]fluoranthene exceeded 0.672 μg m−3, we observed a high number of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases for 15-65 years-old people. The study also revealed the important influence of socio-economy (e.g., single-parent family, people with no qualification at 15 years-old) on pathologies (e.g., cardiovascular diseases). Finally, a diffuse polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) pollution was observed in the study area and can potentially cause lung cancers.

                     Introduction: Road traffic crashes represent a major public health concern, so it is of significant importance to understand the factors associated with the increase of injury severity of its interveners when involved in a road crash. Determining such factors is essential to help decision making in road safety management, improving road safety, and reducing the severity of future crashes. Method: This paper presents a recent literature review of the methods that have been applied to road crash injury severity modeling. It includes 56 studies from 2001 to 2021 that consider more than 20 different statistical or machine learning techniques. Results: Random Forest was the algorithm with the best results, achieving the best performance in 70% of the times that it was applied and in 29% of all studies. Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree achieved the best performance in 53% and 31% of the times and in 16% and 14% of all studies, respectively. Bayesian Networks and K-Nearest Neighbors achieved the best performance in 67% and 40% of the times that were used but only achieved the best performance in 4% and 7% of all the studies analyzed, respectively. Conclusions: At this point, Random Forest revealed to be a good approach for road traffic crash injury severity prediction followed by Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor. However, there is still a lot of room in this area to explore other techniques that can best suit this purpose as not only the model's performance should be considered but also causality issues, unobserved heterogeneity, and temporal instability. Practical Applications: This review enables researchers to understand the recent techniques applied in the analysis of injury severity modeling, and the ones that achieved the best performance results. Based on the reviewed studies, challenges and future research directions are presented.

                  As one of the most concerned issues in modern society, air quality has received extensive attentions from the public and the government, which promotes the continuous development and progress of air quality forecasting technology. In this study, an automated air quality forecasting system based on machine learning has been developed and applied for daily forecasts of six common pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) and pollution levels, which can automatically find the best “Model + Hyperparameters” without human intervention. Five machine learning models and an ensemble model (Stacked Generalization) were integrated into the system, supported by a knowledge base containing the meteorological observed data, pollutant concentrations, pollutant emissions, and model reanalysis data. Then five-year data (2015–2019) of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Changchun in China, were used as an application case to study the effectiveness of the automated forecasting system. Based on the analysis of seven evaluation criteria and pollution level forecasts, combined with the forecasting results for the next 3-days, it is found that the automated system can achieve satisfactory forecasting performance, better than most of numerical model results. This implied that the developed system unveils a good application prospect in the field of environmental meteorology.

But in recent times agriculture production is following a downward trend due to various plant diseases with an increase in investment costs. This work conducts a survey on deep learning techniques training issues related to a Chili leaf diseases dataset. Especially the work focused on the viability of the Squeeze-Net training architecture on the Chili leaves to train the two classes of diseased leaves namely Geminivirus and Mosaic. The dataset comprised of 160 Chili diseased photographs deployed from the Kaggle public domain is subjected to the Squeeze-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) to test the training accuracy. The obtained training accuracy ranges from 50% to 100% by considering various training properties like CNN optimizers SGDM, ADAM, and RMSPROP w.r.t Max_Epoches and assigning Dropout probability, Strides, Dilation factor, and padding values as constants. From the simulation is observed that the Squeeze-Net CNN architecture is achieving 100% accuracy in ADAM, and RMSPROP, where Max_Epoches are 40 and 35 respectively. But it suggested that the applicability of RMSPROP is good for training the Chili Dataset, where Max_Epoches are very less compared to the ADAM and SGDM."

                  This paper deals with the tricky issue of forecasting the number of daily orders received by a delivery company that operates through the internet. The research tries to address the problem through the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP). The more important step of the methodology is the identification and characterization of the features to adopt as inputs for the MLP in the cited case. The number of visits (NVs) to the company website, months, days of the week and the public holidays are the four features used to predict the number of received orders (NOs). The Levenberg Marquardt back-propagation algorithm was used to train the model. The proposed methodology was applied by a delivery company, which operates in Italy, to forecast the daily demand. The results showed a good accuracy of the MLP in predicting the NOs, with a Root Mean Squared Error of the 20% from the actual NOs.

                  Harmful air pollutant such as PM2.5 is still a major concern in many countries. At high concentrations, it could lead to adverse health effect on human, escalating the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In order to mitigate this issue, continuous air quality monitoring systems have been deployed to alert the general public of high PM2.5 level. However, such monitoring system requires substantial budget and resources to construct, thus may not be accessible in some regions especially developing countries. Therefore, it is important to develop a high performance PM2.5 prediction model that only employs easily attainable input parameters as a more cost-effective alternative. In this study, common meteorological data from five different cities in China were utilized for the PM2.5 prediction model. Dynamic model such as the nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) with different input/output time lag were applied to transform training dataset into different data structures. Additionally, machine learning algorithms were analysed and evaluated to predict PM2.5, namely: multi-linear regression (MLR), and feed-forward artificial neural network (FANN). The results shows that FANN model with 10 hidden neurons using NARX-2 data structure is the best model combination with an R2 values of up to 0.973.

                     With the growing urbanization process in several cities around the world, air pollution mitigation has become one of the main environmental challenges of the present time. Recently, low-cost air pollution sensors have become a current trend in the air quality control area since they are an affordable alternative for deploying air quality monitoring systems with high spatial resolution. However, the main drawback of these sensors is that they tend to provide measurements with lower accuracy and reliability compared to traditional air quality monitoring stations. Therefore, periodical calibration of these sensors is essential to maintain the quality of their measurements. This work presents a novel air quality sensor calibration method based on a Bayesian neural network model. The proposed method is assessed using a real public available dataset. The test experiment results show that the method has a good accuracy performance, with a lower mean absolute error compared to other machine learning-based calibration methods applied to the same dataset. In addition, the method presents the advantage of directly providing estimations of the uncertainty of the calibrated measurements, which is an important metric used to assess the quality and reliability of data provided by air pollution sensors and that most other calibration methods usually cannot provide.

Uninformed investments in countermeasures may result in a waste of resources if the risk is negligible. However, risks are difficult to quantify in an objective manner because of uncertainties, speculations, and subjective assumptions. This study contributes a probabilistic model, validated by ten different machine learning methods applied to the fusion of six heterogeneous datasets, to objectively quantify risks at different jurisdictional scales. The risk index is purposefully simple to quickly inform a proportional prioritization of resources to make fair investment decisions that stakeholders can easily understand, and to guide policy formulation. The main finding is that the risk indices among public transit jurisdictions in the United States distribute normally. This result enables agencies to evaluate the quality of their risk index calculations by detecting an outlier or a large deviation from the expected value."

And yet AI has a high potential for abuse and creates risks, which if not managed and monitored will jeopardize respect and dignity of the most vulnerable in society. In this study, we argue for delineating public procurements’ role in the human-centred AI (HCAI) discourses, focusing on the developing countries. The study is based on an exploratory inquiry and gathered data among procurement practitioners in Uganda and Kenya, which have similar country procurement regimes: where traditional forms of competition in procurement apply compared to more recent pre-commercial procurement mechanisms that suit AI procurement. We found limited customization in AI technologies, a lack of developed governance frameworks, and little knowledge and distinction between AI procurement and other typical technology procurement processes. We proposed a framework, which in absence of good legal frameworks can allow procurement professionals to embed HCAI principles in AI procurement processes."

                  Background and aims
                  The development of vaccines against COVID-19 has been a global purpose since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic. People usually use social media, especially Twitter, to transfer knowledge and beliefs on global concerns like COVID-19-vaccination, hence, Twitter is a good source for investigating public opinions. The present study aimed to assess Persian tweets to (1) analyze Iranian people's view toward COVID-19 vaccination. (2) Compare Iranian views toward a homegrown and imported COVID-19-vaccines.
               
                  Methods
                  First, a total of 803278 Persian tweets were retrieved from Twitter, mentioning COVIran Barekat (the homegrown vaccine), Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Moderna, and Sinopharm (imported vaccines) between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Then, we identified sentiments of retrieved tweets using a deep learning sentiment analysis model based on CNN-LSTM architecture. Finally, we investigated Iranian views toward COVID-19-vaccination.
               
                  Results
                  (1) We found a subtle difference in the number of positive sentiments toward the homegrown and foreign vaccines, and the latter had the dominant positive polarity. (2) The negative sentiment regarding homegrown and imported vaccines seems to be increasing in some months. (3) We also observed no significant differences between the percentage of overall positive and negative opinions toward vaccination amongst Iranian people.
               
                  Conclusions
                  It is worrisome that the negative sentiment toward homegrown and imported vaccines increases in Iran in some months. Since public healthcare agencies aim to increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines to end the pandemic, they can focus on social media such as Twitter to promote positive messaging and decrease opposing views.

                  Introduction
                  As SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, Australia was no exception. Part of the Australian response was a robust primary care approach, involving changes to care models (including telehealth) and the widespread use of data to inform the changes. This paper outlines how a large primary care database responded to provide real-time data to inform policy and practice. Simply extracting the data is not sufficient. Understanding the data is. The POpulation Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) program is designed to use GP data for multiple objectives and is built on a pre-existing engagement framework established over a fifteen-year period. Initially developed to provide QA activities for general practices and population level data for General Practice support organisations, the POLAR platform has demonstrated the critical ability to design and deploy real-time data analytics solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic for a variety of stakeholders including state and federal government agencies.
               
                  Methods
                  The system extracts and processes data from over 1,300 general practices daily. Data is de-identified at the point of collection and encrypted before transfer. Data cleaning for analysis uses a variety of techniques, including Natural Language Processing and coding of free text information. The curated dataset is then distilled into several analytic solutions designed to address specific areas of investigation of interest to various stakeholders. One such analytic solution was a model we created that used multiple data inputs to rank patient geographic areas by the likelihood of a COVID-19 outbreak. The model utilised pathology ordering, COVID-19 related diagnoses, indication of COVID-19 related concern (via progress notes) and also incorporated state based actual confirmed case figures.
               
                  Results
                  Using the methods described, we were able to deliver real-time data feeds to practices, Primary Health Networks (PHN) and other agencies. In addition, we developed a COVID-19 geographic risk stratification based on local government areas (LGAs) to pro-actively inform the primary care response. Providing PHNs with a list of geographic priority hotspots allowed for better targeting and response of Personal Protective Equipment allocation and pop-up clinic placement.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The program summarised here demonstrates the ability of a well-designed system underpinned by accurate and reliable data, to respond in real-time to a rapidly evolving public health emergency in a way which supports and enhances the health system response.

                  Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with various adverse health outcomes and poses serious concerns for public health. However, ground monitoring stations for PM2.5 measurements are mostly installed in population-dense or urban areas. Thus, satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, which provide spatial and temporal surrogates of exposure, have become an important tool for PM2.5 estimates in a study area. In this study, we used AOD estimates of surface PM2.5 together with meteorological and land use variables to estimate monthly PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 3 km2 over Taiwan Island from 2015 to 2019. An ensemble two-stage estimation procedure was proposed, with a generalized additive model (GAM) for temporal-trend removal in the first stage and a random forest model used to assess residual spatiotemporal variations in the second stage. We obtained a model-fitting R2 of 0.98 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.40

                  This paper reports an investigation to assess consumer preferences towards Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) in a typical Indian context. A stated preference survey was designed to collect choice responses from current owners of conventional vehicles (CVs) in two Indian megacities namely Delhi and Kolkata. The data collected from the two cities were analyzed in two stages by developing Mixed Logit (ML) models. In the first stage, consumers’ perceived benefit towards PHEV-related attributes were estimated in terms of Willingness to Pay (WTP) values. In the second stage, the potential demand shift from CV to PHEV was estimated by developing demand models. The results indicate the need for an added emphasis on PHEV-specific attributes such as charging time and battery warranty and attribute for general vehicle use such as advance vehicle technology (AVT) option by vehicle manufacturers to make PHEV attractive to consumers in Indian megacities. High purchase price is identified as a major bottleneck for the penetration of PHEV in Indian market. Policy interventions from government in terms of higher subsidy, availability of public charging infrastructure, and environmental education and awareness among consumers are necessary to effectively promote PHEV in Indian context.

Open Data Ecosystems (ODE) is an emerging concept for data sharing under public licenses in software ecosystems, similar to Open Source Software (OSS). It has certain similarities to Open Government Data (OGD), where public agencies share data for innovation and transparency. We aimed to explore open data ecosystems involving commercial actors. Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs’ value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research. We found that ODE must be value driven. Regarding the intrinsics of data, we found their type, meta-data, and legal frameworks influential for their openness. We also found the characteristics of ecosystem initiation, organization, data acquisition and openness be differentiating, which we advise research and practice to take into consideration."

                  Despite significant theoretical and empirical attention on public value creation in the public sector, the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) use and value creation from the citizen perspective remains poorly understood. We ground our study in Moore’s public value management to examine the relationship between AI use and value creation. We conceptually categorize public service value into public value and private value. We use procedural justice and trust in government as indicators of public value and, based on motivation theory, we use perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment as indicators of private value. A field survey of 492 AI voice robot users in China was conducted to test our model. The results indicated that the effective use of AI voice robots was significantly associated with private value and procedural justice. However, the relationship between the effective use of AI and trust in government was not found to be significant. Surprisingly, the respondents indicated that private value had a greater effect on overall value creation than public value. This contrasts with the common idea that value creation from the government perspective suggests that social objectives requiring public value are more important to citizens. The results also show that gender and citizens with different experiences show different AI usage behaviors.

However, if a new DMU needs to be known its efficiency score, the DEA analysis would have to be re-conducted, especially nowadays, datasets from many fields have been growing rapidly in the real world, which will need a huge amount of computation. Following the previous studies, this paper aims to establish a linkage between the DEA method and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and proposes an alternative way that combines DEA with ML (ML-DEA) algorithms to measure and predict the DEA efficiency of DMUs. Four ML-DEA algorithms are discussed, namely DEA-CCR model combined with back-propagation neural network (BPNN-DEA), with genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with back-propagation neural network (GANN-DEA), with support vector machines (SVM-DEA), and with improved support vector machines (ISVM-DEA), respectively. To illustrate the applicability of above models, the performance of Chinese manufacturing listed companies in 2016 is measured, predicted and compared with the DEA efficiency scores obtained by the DEA-CCR model. The empirical results show that the average accuracy of the predicted efficiency of DMUs is about 94%, and the comprehensive performance order of four ML-DEA algorithms ranked from good to poor is GANN-DEA, BPNN-DEA, ISVM-DEA, and SVM-DEA."

                  Urban air pollution is one of the most critical issues that affect the environment, community health, economy, and management of urban areas. From a public health perspective, PM2.5 is one of the primary air pollutants, especially in Tehran's metropolis. Owing to the different patterns of PM2.5 in different seasons, Spatio-temporal modeling and identification of high-risk areas to reduce its effects seems necessary. The purpose of this study was Spatio-temporal modeling and preparation of PM2.5 risk mapping using three machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)) in the metropolis of Tehran, Iran. Therefore, in the first step, to prepare the dependent variable data, the PM2.5 average was used for the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Then, using remote sensing (RS) and a geographic information system (GIS), independent data such as temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, rainfall, humidity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population density, street density, and distance to industrial centers were prepared as a seasonal average. To Spatio-temporal modeling using machine learning algorithms, 70% of the data were used for training and 30% for validation. The frequency ratio (FR) model was used as input to machine learning algorithms to calculate the spatial relationship between PM2.5 and the effective parameters. Finally, Spatio-temporal modeling and PM2.5 risk mapping were performed using three machine learning algorithms. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) results showed that the RF algorithm had the greatest modeling accuracy, with values of 0.926, 0.94, 0.949, and 0.949 for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. According to the RF model, the most important variable in spring and autumn was NDVI. Temperature and distance to industrial centers were the most important variables in the summer and winter, respectively. The results showed that autumn, winter, summer, and spring had the highest risk of PM2.5, respectively.

                  The world's poorest countries were hit hardest by COVID-19 due to their limited capacities to combat the pandemic. The urban water supply and water consumption are affected by the pandemic because it intensified the existing deficits in the urban water supply and sanitation services. In this study, we develop an integrated spatial analysis approach to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on multi-dimensional Urban Water Consumption Patterns (UWCPs) with the aim of forecasting the water demand. We selected the Tabriz metropolitan area as a case study area and applied an integrated approach of GIS spatial analysis and regression-based autocorrelation assessment to develop the UWCPs for 2018, 2019 and 2020. We then employed GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis and a CA-Markov model to analyze the water demand under the impacts of COVID-19 and to forecast the UWCPs for 2021, 2022 and 2023. In addition, we tested the spatial uncertainty of the prediction maps using the Dempster Shafer Theory. The results show that the domestic water consumption increased by 17.57% during the year 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum increase in water consumption was observed in spring 2020 (April–June) when strict quarantine regulations were in place. Based on our results, the annual water deficit in Tabriz has increased from ~18% to about 30% in 2020. In addition, our projections show that this may further increase to about 40–45% in 2021. Relevant stakeholders can use the findings to develop evidence-informed strategies for sustainable water resource management in the post-COVID era. This research also makes other significant contributions. From the environmental perspective, since COVID-19 has affected resource management in many parts of the world, the proposed method can be applied to similar contexts to mitigate the adverse impacts and developed better informed recovery plans.

                  Station-based one-way carsharing (OWC) serves as a flexible method to enjoy the benefits of car travel, while also demonstrating the potential to mitigate environmental challenges and traffic congestion in cities. In the previous studies on OWC, location-based units such as a single station, station cluster, and land parcel were generally used as the basic analysis units for demand; however, these studies failed to consider the association among the operating areas. This led to results that were pertinent to a specific OWC system and cross-section of the development process. The objective of this study is to explore the significant factors related to flow-based demand (i.e., four-weekly bookings from the origin spatial unit to the destination spatial unit (OD bookings)). Four groups of explanatory variables are adopted: carsharing spatial unit attributes, built environment, transportation facilities, and OD trip attributes (such as public transportation and car travel distance between the OD). A combination model integrating machine learning and a generalized linear model is also developed to address the zero-inflation issue of the data. Moreover, an approach of Shapley additive explanations is implemented to determine the considerable effects of the factors. The results show that (1) the OD trip attributes play an important role in estimating the carsharing OD demand; (2) taxi and carsharing demands exhibit a non-significant partial overlap, and carsharing may compete with buses and supplement to the metro; and (3) the travel purpose in carsharing is diverse for any land use over a four-week period.

                  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are hardware, network, and software, upon which a facility depends to allow daily operations to function. In most cases society takes the operation of such systems, for example public transport, tap water or electricity, for granted. However, the disruption of those systems might have serious consequences across different sectors. In this paper, we propose a supervised energy-based approach for anomaly detection in a clean water supply system using a new dataset which is physically modelled in the Festo MPA workstation rig. The novelty relies on the set of engineered features collected from the testbed, including voltage, current and power from the sensors that compose the ICS. These values are obtained from independent current sensors that we have physically wired to the testbed. Five machine learning algorithms; Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbours, Multilayer Perceptron, Decision Tree and Random Forest are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed features. The metrics used to present the performance of the selected machine learning algorithms are F1-Score, G-Mean, False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR). The results show that machine learning algorithms can classify the variations of energy produced by the execution of cyber-attacks as anomalous by achieving 95.5% F1-Score, and 6.8% FNR with the Multilayer Perceptron classifier.

IoHT unit retains connectivity continuously generates data from patients. Heuristic Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) algorithm is used to select most relevant attributes of lung cancer data upon which random forest algorithm is applied to classify and differentiates lung cancer affected patients from normal ones based on detected symptoms.

While an optimal accuracy of 98.8 % was generated, simultaneously, the least latency of 1.16 s was noted. Specificity and sensitivity recorded with the proposed model on lung cancer data are 97.5 % and 97.8 %, respectively. The mean accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and f-score value recorded is 96.96 %, 96.26 %, 96.34 %, and 96.32 %, respectively, over various types of cancer datasets implemented.

                  Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is an interdisciplinary research area of ICT which has evolved since the 90s, taking great advantage from the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). AmI creates, by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), an intelligent ecosystem in which computers, sensors, lighting, music, personal devices, and distributed services, work together to improve the user experience through the support of natural and intuitive user interfaces. Nowadays, AmI is used in various contexts, e.g., for building smart homes and smart cities, providing healthcare, and creating an adequate atmosphere in retail and public environments.
                  In this paper, we propose a novel AmI system for gym environments, named Gym Intelligence, able to provide adequate music atmosphere, according to the users’ physical effort during the training. The music is taken from Spotify and is classified according to some music features, as provided by Spotify itself. The system is based on a multi-agent computational intelligence model built on two main components: 
                        
                           (
                           i
                           )
                        
                      machine learning methods that forecast appropriate values for the Spotify music features, and 
                        
                           (
                           ii
                           )
                        
                      a multi-objective dynamic genetic algorithm that selects a specific Spotify music track, according to such values. Gym Intelligence is built by sensing the ambient with a minimal, low-cost, and non-intrusive set of sensors, and it has been designed considering the outcome of a preliminary analysis in real gyms, involving real users. We have considered well-known regression methods and we have validated them using a collected data 
                        
                           (
                           i
                           )
                        
                      about the users’ physical effort, through the sensors, and 
                        
                           (
                           ii
                           )
                        
                      about the users’ music preferences, through an Android app that the users have used during the training. Among the regression methods considered, the one that provided the best results is the Random Forest, which predicted Spotify music features with a mean absolute error of 0.02 and a root mean squared error of 0.05. We have implemented Gym Intelligence and deployed it in five real gyms. We have evaluated it conducting several experiments. The experiments show how, with the help of Gym Intelligence, the users’ satisfaction about the provided background music, rose from 3.05 to 4.91 (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the maximum score).

                  Monitoring and management of drinking water distribution networks (DWDNs), including possible leaching from materials in contact with drinking water, have been stressed as crucial to avoid re-contamination of drinking water leading to a potential increase of human health risk. Recent scientific studies and regulations clearly highlighted the leaching of bisphenol A (BPA) from plastic materials used to renovate DWDNs pipelines as one of the major hazardous source, resulting in severe consequences for human health. In this study, lab migration tests were performed on three commercial epoxy resins, designed with the Design of Experiments (DoE) method in order to build a BPA migration model as a function of water chemical stability, evaluated as aggressivity index (AI), and residual chlorine concentration. Tests lasted about 170 days to account for both short and long-term leaching. BPA migration over time was well described by a combination of two 1st-order kinetic models with an initial peak of leaching, a decrease and, then, a second increase due to resins' deterioration. Initial BPA concentration in the contact water and BPA integral migration over time showed inverse proportionality with both chlorine concentration and AI values. However, measurements of free BPA content in epoxy resins proved that this is due to BPA transformation, not to a reduced leaching. The validated BPA migration model was combined with the hydraulic model of the DWDN in an urban area, through EPANET-MSX software. The model allowed to simulate the propagation of BPA in the DWDN, after the execution of a relining intervention, identifying the most vulnerable areas and permitting to customize a site-specific monitoring and intervention plan to minimize the health risk for final consumers.

                  Reliable urban road vector maps are essential for urban analysis because the spatial distribution of road networks reflects urban development under the combined effects of nature and socio-economics. Diverse very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images are now available, enabling explicit extraction of urban road vector maps over wide areas. Urban road vectorization mapping consists of two separate tasks: road extraction and road vectorization. The traditional methods focus on the road extraction task, and can obtain a good performance when using a pixel-based metric. However, the road vectorization methods are faced with the problem of road connectivity. In this work, to implement urban road vectorization mapping in a unified way, an end-to-end road vectorization mapping network (RVMNet) framework is proposed. The proposed RVMNet framework consists of a node proposal network (NPN) module and a node connectivity based road refinement module. In the NPN module, a fully convolutional network is adopted for the road node extraction. This improves the connectivity of the road mask by providing supervised information in the form of the road nodes, which are actually part of the road mask. The road mask is then converted into a road vector map by vectorization. In the node connectivity based road refinement module, road nodes are inserted into the road vector map to improve the connectivity. We compared RVMNet with the other state-of-the-art road detection methods on two public road datasets (SpaceNet 3 and DeepGlobe). The results of this comparison showed that combining road extraction and road vectorization into a unified framework is an efficient and accurate strategy for urban road vectorization mapping because it can propose road nodes that help to improve the road connectivity. Moreover, we constructed the novel UrbanRoadNet dataset, covering six cities (Beijing city center; Helsinki; Wuhan; Macao; the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong; and Shanghai). We then applied the RVMNet framework to the data from the six cities, obtaining an improvement in the vector-based average path length similarity (APLS) value of 4.1%. The spatial transfer assessments from both the qualitative and quantitative aspects corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method, and further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale road vectorization mapping at a very high resolution. It was also found that road vector spatial distribution is a useful way to reflect urban development.

Passive noise control measures, which are less effective at reducing low-frequency noise and are often bulky and may impede airflow. As evidenced in automobiles, active control of cabin noise has resulted in lighter cars due to reduced passive insulation. Despite its long history and recent popularisation by consumer headphones, the implementation of active noise control in the built environment is still rare. To date, active noise control (ANC) has been demonstrated, at source, in construction machines and, in the transmission path, in noise barriers. Recent demand for naturally-ventilated buildings has also spurred the development of active control solutions at the receiving end, such as on windows. The ten questions aim to demystify the principles of ANC and highlight areas in which environmental noise can be actively mitigated. Since the implementation of active control in the built environment usually involves multiple stakeholders, operational concerns are addressed. To conclude, research gaps are identified that would enable increased adoption of ANC in the built environment. There is also renewed interest in applying intelligent ANC to tackle environmentally complex applications, such as varying noise levels in the earcup of ANC headphones, particularly with the advent of the low-cost, low-power, highly-efficient embedded electronics; advancing speaker technology; and new impetus from digital signal processing and artificial intelligence Algorithms."

                  Nowadays, the European municipal waste management policy based on the circular economy paradigm demands the closing of material and financial loops at all territorial levels of public administration. The effective planning of treatment capacities (especially sorting plants, recycling, and energy recovery facilities) and municipal waste management policy requires an accurate prognosis of municipal waste generation, and therefore, the knowledge of behavioral, socio-economic, and demographic factors influencing the waste management (and recycling) behavior of households, and other municipal waste producers. To enable public bodies at different territorial levels to undertake an effective action resulting in circular economy we evaluated various factors influencing the generation of municipal waste fractions at regional, micro-regional and municipal level in the Czech Republic. Principal components were used as input for traditional models (multivariable linear regression, generalized linear model) as well as tree-based machine learning models (regression trees, random forest, gradient boosted regression trees). Study results suggest that the linear regression model usually offers a good trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability. When the most important goal of the prediction is supposed to be accuracy, the random forest is generally the best choice. The quality of developed models depends mostly on the chosen territorial level and municipal waste fraction. The performance of these models deteriorates significantly for lower territorial levels because of worse data quality and bigger variability. Only the age structure seems to be important across territorial levels and municipal waste fractions. Nevertheless, also other factors are of high significance in explaining the generation of municipal waste fractions at different territorial levels (e.g. number of economic subjects, expenditures, population density and the level of education). Therefore, there is not one single effective public policy dealing with circular economy strategy that fits all territorial levels. Public representatives should focus on policies effective at specific territorial level. However, performance of the models is poor for lower territorial levels (municipality and micro-regions). Thus, results for municipalities and micro-regions are weak and should be treated as such.

                  The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly has a great impact on the world economy, especially the urban economy. It is urgent to study the environmental pathogenic factors and transmission route of it. We want to discuss the relationship between the urban living environment and the number of confirmed cases at the community scale, and examine the driving forces of community infection (e.g., environment, ecology, convenience, livability, and population density). Besides, we hope that our research will help make our cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. 650 communities with confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan were selected as the research objects. We utilize deep learning semantic segmentation technology to calculate the Visible Green Index (VGI) and Sky View Factor (SVF) of street view and use Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to study the driving forces of pandemic situation. Temperature and humidity information recorded by sensors was also used for urban sensing. We find that the more SVF has a certain inhibitory effect on the virus transmission, but contrary to our intuitive perception, higher VGI has a certain promotion effect. Also, the structural equation model constructed in this paper can explain the variance of 28.9% of the number of confirmed cases, and results (path coef.) demonstrate that residential density of community (0.517) is a major influencing factor for pandemic cases, whereas convenience of community living (0.234) strongly influence it. Communities with good suitability of community human settlement (e.g., construction time, price) are safer in the face of pandemic events. Does the influence of SVF and VGI on the results of the pandemic situation mean that sunlight can effectively block the spread of the virus? This spatial heterogeneity in different communities is helpful for us to explore the environmental transmission route of COVID-19.

                  Artificial intelligence integrated with customer relationship management (CRM) systems has revolutionized organizations’ means of analyzing their huge volumes of customer data. To effectively respond to and manage the opportunities and challenges that arise from this, organizations are developing competencies and processes that evolve their agility, fine-tuning them to the artificial intelligence customer service system (AICS) and wider digitalization setting. In this context, this study identifies the factors impacting the adoption of an AI-integrated CRM system (AICS) in agile organizations as a part of their digitalization strategy. Methodologically, the research builds its theoretical foundation on extant works to develop hypotheses and a corresponding conceptual model. The model is quantitatively validated through a survey across the spectrum of Indian companies, following expert-based pretesting and pilot testing, and subsequently it is statistically tested using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results, contextualized against the backdrop of organizational agility, identify and elucidate the relationship between stakeholders and perceived value and easiness of AICS, between employee trust and attitude, and the influence of attitude and behavioral intention as key mediators towards AICS adoption. The findings are conclusively transcribed into tangible implications for practice and explicit avenues for future research.

Such practices, however, pose significant environmental and public health risks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the irrigation suitability of anaerobic digestion brewery effluent (ADBE) and two-stage horizontal subsurface constructed wetland post-treated ADBE (CWPBE). A series of pot experiments were conducted in a plastic - greenhouse system arranged in three sets of irrigation schemes: Treatment Group1 (TG1): municipal pipe tap water (MPTW) irrigated pots; Treatment Group2 (TG2): ADBE irrigated pots, and Treatment Group3 (TG3): CWPBE irrigated pots. Pots packed with the same amount of sandy clay loam soil and local tomato seeds sown were irrigated following an updated tomato irrigation schedule derived from the FAO CROPWAT stimulation model for 120 days. The findings from key irrigation water quality parameters showed that the CWPBE achieved the prescribed irrigation water standards with values of pH (7.4 ± 0.15), electrical conductivity (1.9 ± 0.11 dS.m−1), total suspended solids (25 ± 4.17 mgL-1), chemical oxygen demand (185.1 ± 1.66 mgL-1), total nitrogen (17.4 ± 0.7 mgL-1), total phosphorous (8.8 ± 0.26 mgkg-1), calcium (10.5 ± 3.6 mgkg-1), magnesium (4.9 ± 0.98 mgkg-1), sodium (4.4 ± 1.51 mgkg-1), potassium (2.3 ± 1.15 mgkg-1), sodium adsorption ratio (1.6 ± 0.34), and total coliform (8 ± 0.16×10−5 CFU/100 mL). Moreover, tomato plants grown in TG3 attained higher growth such as number of leaves (85.6 ± 4.68), plant height (92.2 ± 1.29 cm), stem diameter (13.1 ± 2.35 cm) and leaf area (35.5 ± 1.03 cm2) as well as higher biomass (61.2 ± 1.33 kgm−2) and fruit (46.4 ± 3.51 kgm−2) yields over other treatment groups. The results revealed that irrigation waters significantly improved both growth and yield parameters of tomato plants with the ascending order of TG1 < TG2 < TG3. Moreover, CWPBE showed minima short-term residual effect on soil physicochemical properties as compared to ADBE, and thus, it has potential suitability for agricultural irrigation reuse."

                  Fecal pollution remains a challenge for water quality managers at Great Lakes and inland recreational beaches. The fecal indicator of choice at these beaches is typically Escherichia coli (E. coli), determined by culture-based methods that require over 18 h to obtain results. Researchers at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have developed a rapid E. coli qPCR methodology (EPA Draft Method C) that can provide same-day results for improving public health protection with demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and data acceptance criteria. However, limited information is currently available to compare the occurrence of E. coli determined by cultivation and by EPA Draft Method C (Method C). This study provides a large-scale data collection effort to compare the occurrence of E. coli determined by these alternative methods at more than 100 Michigan recreational beach and other sites using the complete set of quantitative data pairings and selected subsets of the data and sites meeting various eligibility requirements. Simple linear regression analyses of composite (pooled) data indicated a correlation between results of the E. coli monitoring approaches for each of the multi-site datasets as evidenced by Pearson R-squared values ranging from 0.452 to 0.641. Theoretical Method C threshold values, expressed as mean log10 target gene copies per reaction, that corresponded to an established E. coli culture method water quality standard of 300 MPN or CFU /100 mL varied only from 1.817 to 1.908 for the different datasets using this model. Different modeling and derivation approaches that incorporated within and between-site variability in the estimates also gave Method C threshold values in this range but only when relatively well-correlated datasets were used to minimize the error. A hypothetical exercise to evaluate the frequency of water impairments based on theoretical qPCR thresholds corresponding to the E. coli water quality standard for culture methods suggested that the methods may provide the same beach notification outcomes over 90% of the time with Method C results differing from culture method results that indicated acceptable and unacceptable water quality at overall rates of 1.9% and 6.6%, respectively. Results from this study provide useful information about the relationships between E. coli determined by culture and qPCR methods across many diverse freshwater sites and should facilitate efforts to implement qPCR-based E. coli detection for rapid recreational water quality monitoring on a large scale in the State of Michigan.

However, large-scale maps of crop type and crop area using satellite imagery are not easily available in some regions, especially Brazil. Reasons for this include limited ground truth data, inadequate spatial and temporal satellite data availability, computational challenges, lack of cropland data and field boundaries. In this paper, we attempted to overcome some of these obstacles by using an ensemble of approaches to generate crop classification maps for Brazil. In order to compensate for the lack of abundant ground truth data in Brazil, we combined extensive field data and satellite input features from the United States with available field data and satellite input features from Brazil to train crop classification model for Brazil. Before applying the crop classification model for Brazil, we classified cropland areas using harmonic functions and delineated field boundaries using a supervised deep learning approach. Cropland masking and field boundary delineation allowed field-level mapping of crop type and crop area. Applying the crop classification model for Brazil in the states of Mato Grosso and Goias gave a true positive accuracy of 88% in the 2017/2018 summer growing season for soybean classification, 95% in the 2018 safrinha growing season for corn classification, and 86% in the 2018/2019 summer growing season for soybean classification. Our crop area estimates also showed a good agreement (correlation of 0.95 and mean absolute error of 0.64) with state-scale statistical data provided by the Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB) in both summer and safrinha growing seasons adding further confidence to the results. These results suggest that extensive data from one geography can be used to train machine learning models in conjunction with limited field data from another geography.

Machine learning models including biomedical data to forecast PTSD outcome after trauma are highly promising for detection of individuals most in need of such interventions. In the current study, machine learning was applied on biomedical data collected within 48 h post-trauma to forecast individual risk for long-term PTSD, using a multinominal approach including the full spectrum of common PTSD symptom courses within one prognostic model for the first time. N = 417 patients (37.2% females; mean age 46.09 ± 15.88) admitted with (suspected) serious injury to two urban Academic Level-1 Trauma Centers were included. Routinely collected biomedical information (endocrine measures, vital signs, pharmacotherapy, demographics, injury and trauma characteristics) upon ED admission and subsequent 48 h was used. Cross-validated multi-nominal classification of longitudinal self-reported symptom severity (IES-R) over 12 months and bimodal classification of clinician-rated PTSD diagnosis (CAPS-IV) at 12 months post-trauma was performed using extreme Gradient Boosting and evaluated on hold-out sets. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to explain the derived models in human-interpretable form. Good prediction of longitudinal PTSD symptom trajectories (multiclass AUC = 0.89) and clinician-rated PTSD at 12 months (AUC = 0.89) was achieved. Most relevant prognostic variables to forecast both multinominal and dichotomous PTSD outcomes included acute endocrine and psychophysiological measures and hospital-prescribed pharmacotherapy. Thus, individual risk for long-term PTSD was accurately forecasted from biomedical information routinely collected within 48 h post-trauma. These results facilitate future targeted preventive interventions by enabling future early risk detection and provide further insights into the complex etiology of PTSD."

                  Modeling the fine-scale spatiotemporal distribution of residential land prices (RLPs) is the basis for scientifically allocating land resources, managing the residential market and improving urban planning. The accurate mapping of the RLP dynamics require reliable land price prediction models and data with fine spatial and temporal resolution. With the aid of point of interest (POI) data and nighttime light (NTL) images, this paper attempts to explore the ability of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to model grid-level RLPs using the case of Wuhan in China. Several land price prediction models were built using five MLAs and various geographic variables. The experimental results show that the extra-trees regression algorithm and the radial basis function-based support vector regression algorithm perform best in Period Ⅰ (2010–2014) and Period Ⅱ (2015–2019), respectively; therefore, they were selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids without observations in the corresponding period. Based on the estimated results, we found that the spatial pattern of the RLP in Wuhan transitioned from monocentric to polycentric between the two periods, and RLPs grew rapidly near newly formed urban subcenters and waterscapes. The relative importance of the predictor variables shows that commercial and educational facilities are important determinants of the RLP distribution in Wuhan; moreover, the relative importance of natural amenities and education facilities increased over time, while that of commercial facilities and public transportation decreased slightly. The case of Wuhan confirms the feasibility of MLAs and openly accessible urban data in modeling fine-scale RLP distributions. Our proposed framework provides a new approach to monitor the urban land price dynamics accurately and closely, which is beneficial for improving the infrastructure layout and achieve smart city growth.

                  In India, the Central and State Pollution Control Boards have commissioned the National Air Monitoring Program (NAMP) which covers 240 cities with 342 monitoring stations. Air Quality Index (AQI) has been categorized into different groups. To predict the AQI in Chennai city, the Dataset was collected, then preprocessed to replace missing values and remove redundant data. The mean, mean square error and standard deviation are extracted using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The combination of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning model is used to classify the AQI values. The proposed deep learning model gives an accurate and specific value for AQI on the city’s specified location compared to the existing techniques. The prediction accuracy is improved in the proposed deep learning method, which will caution the public to reduce to an acceptable level. The deep learning mechanism predicts the AQI values accurately and helps to plan the metropolitan city for sustainable development. The expected AQI value can control the pollution level by incorporating road traffic signal coordination, encouraging the people to use public transportation, and planting more trees on some locations.

                  The experience of walking through a city is influenced by amenities and the visual qualities of its built environment. This paper uses thousands of pedestrian trajectories obtained from GPS signals to construct a desirability index for streets in Boston. We create the index by comparing the actual paths taken by pedestrians with the shortest path between any origin-destination pairs. The index captures pedestrians' willingness to deviate from their shortest path and provides a measure of the scenic and experience value provided by different parts of the city. We then use computer vision techniques combined with georeferenced data to measure the built environment of streets. We show that desirable streets have better access to public amenities such as parks, sidewalks, and urban furniture. They are also sinuous, visually enclosed, have less complex facades, and have more diverse business establishments. These results further our understanding of the value that the built environment brings to pedestrians, enhancing our capacity to design more lively and functional environments.

                  Artificial intelligence (AI) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to transform every aspect of society. Preparing for a “good AI society” has become a hot topic, with growing public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society to enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks associated with its use. However, despite the renewed interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which AI scholarship is moving and whether the field is evolving towards the goal of building a “good AI society”. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and conceptual structure of AI research. It provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how AI research can help understand the social changes brought about by AI and prepare for a “good AI society.” The research agenda is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector management, security, and justice.

                  Many U.S. households lack access to healthful food and rely on inexpensive, processed food with low nutritional value. Surveying access to healthful food is costly and finding the factors that affect access remains convoluted owing to the multidimensional nature of socioeconomic variables. We utilize machine learning with census tract data to predict the modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI), which refers to the percentage of healthful food retailers in a tract and agnostically extract the features of no access—corresponding to a “food desert” and low access—corresponding to a “food swamp.” Our model detects food deserts and food swamps with a prediction accuracy of 72% out of the sample. We find that food deserts and food swamps are intrinsically different and require separate policy attention. Food deserts are lightly populated rural tracts with low ethnic diversity, whereas swamps are predominantly small, densely populated, urban tracts, with more non-white residents who lack vehicle access. Overall access to healthful food retailers is mainly explained by population density, presence of black population, property value, and income. We also show that our model can be used to obtain sensible predictions of access to healthful food retailers for any U.S. census tract.

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to encounter cases where these limited resources are employed in large ""smart city"" projects that have little or no impact on the social good of the community. On the other hand, the work in this article considers specific needs and financial limitations of suburban or rural communities in the mobility sector. This article presents the work in the design, test and performance evaluation of a low-cost, machine learning based, solution for distributed monitoring of the use of public transit in small communities. The proposed solution utilizes a low-resolution infrared array, that provides non-personally identifiable information coupled with a low-power deep learning module. We also compare the machine-based solution to a traditional algorithmic approach. We believe the solution allows small communities, with limited resources, to collect near real-time data that can be employed for evidence-based decisions of coverage and frequency in public transit. The successful collection of this kind of mobility data is vital for small communities as this is needed to support grant applications that are increasingly commonly used to improve public transit or other mobility modes."

The ravages of COVID-19 are leading to profound crises across the world. There is an urgent requirement for analyzing the current pandemic situation, predicting trends over time, and assessing the effectiveness of containment measures. Thus, numerous statistical models, primarily based on the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered or removed (SEIR) model, have been established. However, these models are highly technical, which are difficult for the public and governing bodies to understand and use. To address this issue, we developed a simple operating software based on our improved K-SEIR model termed as the kernel SEIR simulator (K-SEIR-Sim). This software includes natural propagation parameters, containment measure parameters, and certain characteristic parameters that can deduce the effects of natural propagation and containment measures. Further, the applicability of the proposed software was demonstrated using the examples of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, Wuhan city of China, Diamond Princess, and France. Operating results verified the potency of the proposed software in evaluating the epidemic situation and human intervention during COVID-19. Importantly, no installation is required and the software can perform real-time, backward-looking, and forward-looking analysis by functioning in data-driven and model-driven ways. All of them have considerable practical values in their applications according to the actual needs of personal use. Conclusively, K-SEIR-Sim is the first simple customized operating software that is highly valuable for the global fight against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."

                  Over the last decades, oil and gas companies have been facing a continuous increase of data collected in unstructured textual format. New disruptive technologies, such as natural language processing and machine learning, present an unprecedented opportunity to extract a wealth of valuable information within these documents. Word embedding models are one of the most fundamental units of natural language processing, enabling machine learning algorithms to achieve great generalization capabilities by providing meaningful representations of words, being able to capture syntactic and semantic features based on their context. However, the oil and gas domain-specific vocabulary represents a challenge to those algorithms, in which words may assume a completely different meaning from a common understanding. The Brazilian pre-salt is an important exploratory frontier for the oil and gas industry, with increasing attractiveness for international investments in exploration and production projects, and most of its documentation is in Portuguese. Moreover, Portuguese is one of the largest languages in terms of number of native speakers. Nonetheless, despite the importance of the petroleum sector of Portuguese speaking countries, specialized public corpora in this domain are scarce. This work proposes PetroVec, a representative set of word embedding models for the specific domain of oil and gas in Portuguese. We gathered an extensive collection of domain-related documents from leading institutions to build a large specialized oil and gas corpus in Portuguese, comprising more than 85 million tokens. To provide an intrinsic evaluation, assessing how well the models can encode domain semantics from the text, we created a semantic relatedness test set, comprising 1,500 word pairs labeled by selected experts in geoscience and petroleum engineering from both academia and industry. In addition, we performed an extrinsic quantitative evaluation on a downstream task of named entity recognition in geoscience, plus a set of qualitative analyses, and conducted a comparative evaluation against a public general-domain embedding model. The obtained results suggest that our domain-specific models outperformed the general model on their ability to represent specialized terminology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate and evaluate word embedding models for the oil and gas domain in Portuguese. Finally, all the resources developed by this work are made available for public use, including the pre-trained specialized models, corpora, and validation datasets.

                  Estimating health outcomes at a neighborhood scale is important for promoting urban health, yet costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-enabled approach to predicting the prevalence of six common non-communicable chronic diseases at the census tract level. We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes. By analyzing where the most significant discrepancies between the predicted and the actual values are, we will also be ready to identify areas of best practice and areas in need of greater investment or policy intervention.

                  Social networks are platforms widely used by travelers who express their opinions about many services like public transport. This paper investigates the value of texts from social networks as a data source for detecting the spatial distribution of problems within a public transit network by geolocating citizens' feelings, and analyzes the effects some factors such as population or income have over that spatial spread, with the goal of developing a more intelligent and sustainable public transit service. For that purpose, Twitter data from the Madrid Metro account is collected over a two-month period. Topics and sentiments are identified from text mining and machine learning algorithms, and mapped to explore spatial and temporal patterns. Lastly, a Geographically Weighted Regression model is used to explore the causality of the spatial distribution of complaining users, by using official data sources as exploratory variables. Results show Twitter users tend to be mid-income workers who reside in peripheral areas and mainly tweet when traveling to workplaces. The main detected problems were punctuality and breakdowns in transfer stations or in central areas, mainly in the early morning of weekdays, and affected by density of points of interest in destination areas.

                  Adequate spatial coverage by the emergency medical service and the ability to reach any location in the area of interest in the shortest possible time are crucial for the survival of patients with serious conditions. Knowledge of blind spots (i.e. sites that cannot be reached within the required time) represents key information for improving the service quality and may lead, e.g. to a relocation of bases or to other active interventions. Spatial coverage can be derived from experience based on historical data. Such an approach may be problematic if a larger area is being analysed, especially if data is not available for some parts of such areas or if no data is available. To eliminate such problems, we created a prediction model utilising the random forest ensemble learning method. The model is capable of predicting the travel time based on available historical data on ambulance movements (GPS) and the geometric and construction characteristics of individual road segments. We therefore collaborated with the regional public administration and emergency medical service authorities to deliver a time- and resource-efficient solution for emergency spatial planning practice. The outputs from the newly built model were subsequently validated against data from an empirical model currently used by the regional authorities. The results from both models were compared from the perspective of performance in various seasonal and time-of-day conditions. The prediction of travel times using the new model improved according to all the evaluated validation metrics. The importance and applicability of the foregoing model lies in the fact that it can be incorporated into the current emergency medical service management system in a simple manner in terms of data availability and the required computational resources. We conclude that the dynamic model presented in this paper represents an improvement relative to the reference data, and discuss the possibilities of further improving the proposed model.

Model-based economic evaluation provides useful guidance for decision making while characterizing decision uncertainty. We aim to quantify the value of eliminating uncertainty about different parameters in selecting combination implementation strategies to reduce the public health burden of HIV/AIDS in 6 US cities and identify future data collection priorities. Methods We used a dynamic compartmental HIV transmission model developed for 6 US cities to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a range of combination implementation strategies. Using a metamodeling approach with nonparametric and deep learning methods, we calculated the expected value of perfect information, representing the maximum value of further research to eliminate decision uncertainty, and the expected value of partial perfect information for key groups of parameters that would be collected together in practice. Results The population expected value of perfect information ranged from $59 683 (Miami) to $54 108 679 (Los Angeles). The rank ordering of expected value of partial perfect information on key groups of parameters were largely consistent across cities and highest for parameters pertaining to HIV risk behaviors, probability of HIV transmission, health service engagement, HIV-related mortality, health utility weights, and healthcare costs. Los Angeles was an exception, where parameters on retention in pre-exposure prophylaxis ranked highest in contributing to decision uncertainty. Conclusions Funding additional data collection on HIV/AIDS may be warranted in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and New York City. Value of information analysis should be embedded into decision-making processes on funding future research and public health intervention."

Career competencies, being central to the self-management and development of one's career, are necessary for proactive management of careers; they help to guide the individuals towards subjective career success which subsequently leads to organization success. However, there is a lack of career competencies intervention practices in the Malaysian public service. Therefore, this study aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a user and expert centric mobile phone-based career intervention program of career competencies among Malaysian public managers. In this study, the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) is adopted as the framework to develop mobile phone-based intervention for career competencies. Method This is a sequential exploratory mixed method study which involves, in Phase 1, a qualitative approach: reviewing of literature and interviewing experts and public servants who are users of mobile phones so as to obtain their perspectives regarding the components in the career intervention module and mobile phone application features. A quantitative approach is implemented in Phase 2 that evaluates the mobile phone-based career intervention program. Validation will be conducted to meet the objectives of (i) the usability of the mobile communication career intervention application (survey), and (ii) evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention program for career competencies delivered through mobile phone application (randomized controlled trial). The career intervention program consists of five modules through which development is based on reflective, communicative and behavioral dimensions. Outcome The primary outcome of this study is career competencies. The career competencies score will be compared between participants in the intervention and control group at the baseline, and follow-ups at week four and week 12 respectively, using mixed design ANOVA. Discussion The results from this study will indicate the effectiveness of the career intervention program for career competencies in the reformation of public services management. The intervention can serve as a new modality to enhance career competencies among public managers in Malaysia if its effectiveness is proven."

However, few objective exposure data are available to compare the associations of PM1 and PM2.5 with children lung function. Our objectives are a) to evaluate associations between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5 and children’s lung function, and b) to compare the associations between PM1 and PM2.5. From 2012 to 2013, we enrolled 6,740 children (7–14 years), randomly recruited from primary and middle schools located in seven cities in northeast China. We measured lung function including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) utilizing two portable electronic spirometers. We dichotomized continuous lung function measures according the expected values for gender and age. The spatial resolution at which PM1 and PM2.5 estimated were estimated using a machine learning method and the temporal average concentrations were averaged from 2009 to 2012. A multilevel regression model was used to estimate the associations of PM1, PM2.5 exposure and lung function measures, adjusted for confounding factors. Associations with lower lung function were consistently larger for PM1 than for PM2.5. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) per interquartile range greater PM1 ranged from 1.53 for MMEF (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20–1.96) to 2.14 for FEV1 (95% CI: 1.66–2.76) and ORs for PM2.5 ranged from 1.36 for MMEF (95%CI: 1.12–1.66) to 1.82 for FEV1 (95%CI: 1.49–2.22), respectively. PM1 and PM2.5 had significant associations with FVC and FEV1 in primary school children, and on PEF and MMEF in middle school children. Long-term PM1 and PM2.5 exposure can lead to decreased lung function in children, and the associations of PM1 are stronger than PM2.5. Therefore, PM1 may be more hazardous to children’s respiratory health than PM2.5 exposure."

                  Livelihood security plays a critical role in strengthening the socio- economic situation of a country. Agriculture is one such sector which is expected to provide a complete array of economic, social, and environmental services. Good governance and management of allied policies at all levels is favourable for long-term sustainability of agricultural sector. The accountability of government is a direct measure of its social responsibility and sustainability. Social media as a powerful online platform reinforces hype and provides opportunities to extract and analyze public opinion about various governmental schemes and policies including the ones related to agriculture. The e-participation platforms such as Twitter offer unparallel means to intelligently gauge the consensus and orientation of people towards an agricultural policy. Motivated by this, the work presented in this research, proffers a Socio-Sentic framework for sustainable agricultural governance which probes the sentiment polarity of user-content on Twitter pertaining to government policies, specifically agricultural policies. In this intelligent analytic framework, supervised machine learning algorithms have been implemented and compared using tweets on an Indian Agricultural Policy launched in 2016, ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ (PMFBY). The preliminary results indicate that the adoption of the proposed framework for soliciting and probing citizen feedback for government policy evaluation can lead to a sustainable agricultural development.

                  The effective data mining of social media has become increasingly recognized for its value in informing decision makers of public welfare. However, existing studies do not fully exploit the underlying merit of big data. In this study, we develop a data-driven framework that integrates machine learning with spatial statistics, and then use it on Xiamen Island, China to delineate urban population dynamic patterns based on hourly Baidu heat map data collected from August 25 to September 3, 2017. The results showed that hot grids are primarily clustered along the main street through the downtown area during working days, whereas cold grids are often observed at the edge of the city during the weekend. The mixed use (of commercial and life services, restaurants and snack bars, offices, leisure areas and sports complexes) is the most significant contributing factor. A new cold grid emerged near conference venues before the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Summit, revealing the strong effects of regulations on population dynamics and its evolving patterns. This study demonstrates that the proposed data-driven framework might offer new insights into urban population dynamics and its driving mechanism in support of sustainable urban development.

                  Four microbes (Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp.) were monitored in 16 waterways that supply public drinking water for 13 New Zealand towns and cities. Over 500 samples were collected from the abstraction point at each study site every three months between 2009 and 2019. The waterways represent a range from small to large, free flowing to reservoir impoundments, draining catchments of entirely native vegetation to those dominated by pastoral agriculture. We used machine learning algorithms to explore the relative contribution of land use, catchment geology, vegetation, topography, and water quality characteristics of the catchment to determining the abundance and/or presence of each microbe. Sites on rivers draining predominantly agricultural catchments, the Waikato River, Oroua River and Waiorohi Stream had all four microbes present, often in high numbers, throughout the sampling interval. Other sites, such as the Hutt River and Big Huia Creek in Wellington which drain catchments of native vegetation, never had pathogenic microbes detected, or unsafe levels of E. coli. Boosted Regression Tree models could predict abundances and presence/absence of all four microbes with good precision using a wide range of potential environmental predictors covering land use, geology, vegetation, topography, and nutrient concentrations. Models were more accurate for protozoa than bacteria but did not differ markedly in their ability to predict abundance or presence/absence. Environmental drivers of microbe abundance or presence/absence also differed depending on whether the microbe was protozoan or bacterial. Protozoa were more prevalent in waterways with lower water quality, higher numbers of ruminants in the catchment, and in September and December. Bacteria were more abundant with higher rainfall, saturated soils, and catchments with greater than 35% of the land in agriculture. Although modern water treatment protocols will usually remove many pathogens from drinking water, several recent outbreaks of waterborne disease due to treatment failures, have highlighted the need to manage water supplies on multiple fronts. This research has identified potential catchment level variables, and thresholds, that could be better managed to reduce the potential for pathogens to enter drinking water supplies.

                  Building energy performance benchmarking has been adopted widely in the USA and Canada through the Energy Star Portfolio Manager platform. Building operations and energy management professionals have long used this simple 1–100 score to understand how their building compares to its peers. This single number is easy to use but is created by potentially inaccurate multiple linear regression (MLR) models and lacks much further information about why a building achieves that score. This paper proposes a methodology that enhances the existing Energy Star calculation method by increasing accuracy and providing additional model output processing to help explain why a building is achieving a particular score. Two new prediction models were proposed and tested: multiple linear regression with feature interactions (MLRi) and gradient boosted trees (GBT). Both models performed better than a baseline Energy Star MLR model as well as four baseline models from previous benchmarking studies. This paper shows that for six building types, on average, the third-order MLRi models achieved a 4.9% increase in adjusted

                      and a 7.0% decrease in normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) over the baseline MLR model. More substantially, the most accurate GBT models, on average, achieved a 24.9% increase in adjusted

                      and a 13.7% decrease in NMRSE against the baseline MLR model. In addition, a set of techniques was developed to help determine which factors most influence a building’s energy use versus its peers using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. The SHAP force visualization, in particular, offered an accessible overview of the aspects of the building that influenced the score that even non-technical users can interpret. This methodology was tested on the 2012 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)(1,812 buildings) and public data sets from the energy disclosure programs of New York City (11,131 buildings) and Seattle (2,073 buildings).

                  Urban underground pipelines have complex structures, long service lives, and are susceptible to illegal interference, corrosion, and external force damage. Therefore, they are a constant security risk that seriously threaten the public security of the city. Due to the complexity of the underground environment, lack of various monitoring technologies, high cost, backwardness of emergency technology research, incongruity of safety management, and the transport of flammable, explosive, toxic, and harmful hazardous sources to densely populated areas, the boundary between industrial, residential, and living areas has become increasingly blurred, causing a major threat to public security, people's lives, industrial production, and social stability. Traditional underground pipeline accident prevention and control technology is currently unable to meet the increasing demands of public security. Combining pipeline accident prevention and control with internet of things and artificial intelligence technology can achieve urban disaster prevention, and therefore is of great interest to researchers. Herein, the research status of underground pipeline accident prevention and control technology is summarized, and an analysis of the advantages of applying big data for risk factor monitoring, risk assessment, risk early warning, and emergency decision-making technology is discussed. Further, the application difficulties and difficulties regarding big data technology in underground pipeline accident prevention and control and their potential solutions are detailed.

                  Environmental disasters such as flash floods are becoming more and more prevalent and carry an increasing burden to human civilization. They are usually unpredictable, fast in development and extend across large geographical areas. The consequences of such disasters can be reduced through better monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give timely and accurate information to first responders and the public. Given the extended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying nature of the phenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of locations to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present informative mobile sensor routing algorithms are either short-sighted or computationally demanding when applied to large scale systems. In this paper, a real-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and needs of city-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in forward search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed parameter system, modeling flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the causal relation expressed by a search tree, which describes all possible sequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps in the forward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance matrix between observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a concrete example, numerical experiments in this paper indicate that this scheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning algorithms and other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper relies on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states, and experiments suggest that popular estimation techniques have very good performance when applied to precise data-driven models.

                  In this paper we utilize a structured natural language processing implementation of the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) to extract financial information from the unstructured textual data of the social media platform Twitter regarding financial and budget information in the public sector, namely the two public-private agencies of the Port Authority of NY and NJ (PANYNJ), and the NY Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA). This research initiative uses the Design Science Research (DSR) perspective to develop an artifact to classify tweets as being either relevant to financial bonds or not. We apply a frame and slot approach from the artificial intelligence and natural language processing literature to operationalize this artifact. FIBO provides standards for defining the facts, terms, and relationships associated with financial concepts. We show that FIBO grammar can be used to mine semantic meaning from unstructured textual data and that it provides a nuanced representation of structured financial data. With this artifact, social media such as Twitter may be accessed for the knowledge that its text contains about financial concepts using the FIBO ontology. This process is anticipated to be of interest to bond issuers, regulators, analysts, investors, and academics. It may also be extended towards other financial domains such as securities, derivatives, commodities, and banking that relate to FIBO ontologies, as well as more generally to develop a structured knowledge representation of unstructured data through the application of an ontology.

These factors elevate the urban–rural air temperature (Ta) difference, thus generating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Ta is used in the fields of public health and epidemiology to quantify deaths attributable to heat in cities around the world: the presence of UHI can exacerbate exposure to high temperatures during summer periods, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Measuring and monitoring the spatial patterns of Ta in urban contexts is challenging due to the lack of a good network of weather stations. This study aims to produce a parsimonious model to retrieve maximum Ta (Tmax) at high spatio-temporal resolution using Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) it will produce daily estimations of Tmax for London at 1 km2 during the summertime between 2006 and 2017 using advanced statistical techniques and satellite-derived predictors, and (ii) it will investigate for the first time the predictive power of the gradient boosting algorithm to estimate Tmax for an urban area. In this work, 6 regression models were calibrated with 6 satellite products, 3 geospatial features, and 29 meteorological stations. Stepwise linear regression was applied to create 9 groups of predictors, which were trained and tested on each regression method. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict Tmax: the gradient boosting model with a group of five predictors (land surface temperature, Julian day, normalised difference vegetation index, digital elevation model, solar zenith angle) was the regression model with the best performance (R² = 0.68, MAE = 1.60 °C, and RMSE = 2.03 °C). This methodological approach is capable of being replicated in other UK cities, benefiting national heat-related mortality assessments since the data (provided by NASA and the UK Met Office) and programming languages (Python) sources are free and open. This study provides a framework to produce a high spatio-temporal resolution of Tmax, assisting public health researchers to improve the estimation of mortality attributable to high temperatures. In addition, the research contributes to practice and policy-making by enhancing the understanding of the locations where mortality rates may increase due to heat. Therefore, it enables a more informed decision-making process towards the prioritisation of actions to mitigate heat-related mortality amongst the vulnerable population."

                  Trees provide numerous ecosystem services to benefit human health, and many cities have launched tree planting and management programs to increase tree populations and optimize tree locations through diverse tree priority schemes. Existing tree priority schemes are typically local-specific, expert-driven, and tree-planting-focused. In this study, a framework that captures interactions among the environment, tree and human demographic information is built. This framework provides a composite indicator, namely a tree priority planting or priority protection index (PPI), that can be integrated within a decision support system such as i-Tree Landscape to provide nationally consistent and locally relevant ways to strategically optimize tree planting and management locations across the entire United States. Three scenarios with the human health concerns are tested in a case study of New York City. The analyses are conducted at the census block group scale that is the finest-level scale available at i-Tree Landscape. The resulting PPI maps are analyzed using spatial statistics and compared against each other to investigate the impacts of alternative investments of limited public resources. The results show that: (1) tree priority patterns change greatly with alternative objectives; (2) adding more indicators to build PPIs lead to more diverse tree priority patterns as high (or low) values of different indicators are often not geographically coincident; (3) incorporating more indicators may not necessarily provide more useful information because the influences of individual indicators may be reduced and diluted by a higher level of aggregation; and (4) disaggregating PPIs may reveal corresponding contributions of individual indicators. Applying the proposed framework to build PPIs has important implications for tree priority effort, scientific exploration, education, and public engagement.

                  Football matches, as a common urban activity, produce high levels of noise because of vehicular traffic, screams, whistles, and firework displays. Fear of noise is one of the most commonly reported behavior problems in dogs (Canis familiaris); however, few studies have focused on the effects of repeated exposition to noise in these animals. Here, we investigated whether the noise produced during football matches may act as a stress source for dogs living near football stadiums. We measured noise levels on days with and without matches, in the surrounding neighborhoods of two football stadiums of Minas Gerais, Brazil: (a) Arena Independência (AI) and (b) Governador Magalhães Pinto (GMP). Noise measurements were carried out by using a sound level meter, in distances varying between 0 and 400 m from the stadiums. A structured interview was conducted to dog owners living nearby AI, about the dogs' characteristics, demographics, and behavior. Noise records of days with and without matches were compared, and questionnaires were analyzed (general linear models) to identify possible correlations between the reported changes in the animals’ behaviors on days with football matches and the distance these animals lived from the stadium. Higher noise levels were recorded on football match days than on days without matches, with a greater effect of these between 0 and 249 m (D1) than between 250 and 400 from AI. Around Governador Magalhães Pinto, we recorded greater noise levels on days without football matches compared with match days, with no difference between distances. Fear/anxiety behaviors were reported as more intense on days with football matches, in comparison with days without matches for 90.6% of the study dogs. The occurrence of matches made specific fear-related behaviors of the dogs—severe trembling, excessive salivation, agitation/restlessness, whining, and appetite loss—more frequent. The proximity of AI intensified the exhibition of general fear/anxiety behaviors and made intense trembling and excessive salivation more frequent at D1, in relation to D2. On the other hand, dogs living at D2 barked, howled, and lost appetite more often than those living at D1. Our results suggested a detrimental influence of noise from football matches on the behavior of dogs living around football stadiums. These data are relevant for public policy-making to promote preventive and mitigating measures, to improve the quality of life of both the dog and the human populations in the surroundings of football stadiums.

                  Background
                  Influenza is an important public health problem and existing vaccines are not completely protective. New vaccines that protect by alternative mechanisms are needed to improve efficacy of influenza vaccines. In 2015, we did a phase 1 trial of an oral influenza vaccine, VXA-A1.1. A favourable safety profile and robust immunogenicity results in that trial supported progression of the vaccine to the current phase 2 trial. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine in a human influenza challenge model.
               
                  Methods
                  We did a single-site, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, phase 2 study at WCCT Global, Costa Mesa, CA, USA. Eligible individuals had an initial A/California/H1N1 haemagglutination inhibition titre of less than 20 and were aged 18–49 years and in good health. Individuals were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive a single immunisation of either 1011 infectious units of VXA-A1.1 (a monovalent tablet vaccine) orally, a full human dose of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) via intramuscular injection, or matched placebo. Randomisation was done by computer-generated assignments with block size of five. An unmasked pharmacist provided the appropriate vaccines and placebos to the administrating nurse. Individuals receiving the treatments, investigators, and staff were all masked to group assignments. 90 days after immunisation, individuals without clinically significant symptoms or signs of influenza, an oral temperature of higher than 37·9°C, a positive result for respiratory viral shedding on a Biofire test, and any investigator-assessed contraindications were challenged intranasally with 0·5 mL wild-type A/CA/like(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus. The primary outcomes were safety, which was assessed in all immunised participants through 365 days, and influenza-positive illness after viral challenge, which was assessed in individuals that received the viral challenge and the required number of assessments post viral challenge. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02918006.
               
                  Results
                  Between Aug 31, 2016, and Jan 23, 2017, 374 individuals were assessed for eligibility, of whom 179 were randomly assigned to receive either VXA-A1.1 (n=71 [one individual did not provide a diary card, thus the solicited events were assessed in 70 individuals]), IIV (n=72), or placebo (n=36). Between Dec 2, 2016, and April 26, 2017, 143 eligible individuals (58 in the VXA-A1.1 group, 54 in the IIV group, and 31 in the placebo group) were challenged with influenza virus. VXA-A1.1 was well tolerated with no serious or medically significant adverse events. The most prevalent solicited adverse events for each of the treatment groups after immunisation were headache in the VXA-A1.1 (in five [7%] of 70 participants) and placebo (in seven [19%] of 36 participants) groups and tenderness at injection site in the IIV group (in 19 [26%] of 72 participants) Influenza-positive illness after challenge was detected in 17 (29%) of 58 individuals in the VXA-A1.1 group, 19 (35%) of 54 in the IIV group, and 15 (48%) of 31 in the placebo group.
               
                  Interpretation
                  Orally administered VXA-A1.1 was well tolerated and generated protective immunity against virus shedding, similar to a licensed intramuscular IIV. These results represent a major step forward in developing a safe and effective oral influenza vaccine.

The reach of the Chattahoochee River that flows through the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA), located in the Atlanta-metropolitan area, is a popular recreation area that frequently exceeds the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency beach action value (BAV) for E. coli. A BacteriALERT program has been implemented to provide real-time E. coli estimates in the reach and notify the public of potentially harmful levels of fecal-associated pathogens as indicated by surrogate models based on real-time turbidity measurements from continuous water quality monitoring stations. However, E. coli does not provide information about the sources of fecal contamination and its accuracy as a human health indicator is questionable when sources of contamination are non-human. The objectives of our study were to investigate, within the Park and surrounding watersheds, seasonal and precipitation-related patterns in microbial source tracking marker concentrations of possible sources (human, dog, and ruminant), assess correlations between source contamination levels and culturable E. coli levels, determine which sources best explained model-based E. coli estimates above the BAV and detection of esp2 (a marker for the esp gene associated with pathogenic strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis), and investigate associations between source contamination levels and land use features. Three BacteriALERT sites on the Chattahoochee River were sampled six times per season in the winter and summer from December 2015 through September 2017, and 11 additional stream sites (synoptic sites) from the CRNRA watershed were sampled once per season. Samples were screened with microbial source tracking (MST) quantitative PCR (qPCR) markers for humans (HF183 Taqman), dogs (DogBact), and ruminants (Rum2Bac), the esp2 qPCR marker, and culturable E. coli. At the BacteriALERT sites, HF183 Taqman concentrations were higher under wet conditions DogBact concentrations were greater in the winter and under wet conditions, and Rum2Bac concentrations were comparatively low throughout the study with no difference across seasons or precipitation conditions. Concentrations of HF183 Taqman, DogBact, and Rum2Bac were positively correlated with culturable E. coli concentrations; however, DogBact had the largest R2 value among the three markers, and the forward stepwise regression indicated it was the best predictor of culturable E. coli concentrations at the BacteriALERT sites. Recursive partitioning indicated that BAV exceedances of model-based E. coli estimates were best explained by DogBact concentrations ≥3 gene copies per mL (CN/mL). Detections of esp2 at BacteriALERT sites were best explained by DogBact concentrations ≥11 CN/mL, while detections of esp2 at synoptic sites were best explained by HF183 Taqman ≥29 CN/mL. At the synoptic sites, HF183 Taqman levels were associated with wastewater treatment plant density. However, this relationship was driven primarily by a single site, suggesting possible conveyance issues in that catchment. esp2 detections at synoptic sites were positively associated with development within a 2-km radius and negatively associated with development within the catchment, suggesting multiple sources of esp2 in the watershed. DogBact and Rum2Bac were not associated with the land use features included in our analyses. Implications for Park management include: 1) fecal contamination levels were highest during wet conditions and in the off season when fewer visitors are expected to be participating in water-based recreation, 2) dogs are likely contributors to fecal contamination in the CRNRA and may be sources of pathogenic bacteria indicating further investigation of the origins of this contamination may be warranted as would be research to understand the human health risks from exposure to dog fecal contamination, and 3) high levels of the human marker at one site in the CRNRA watershed suggests more extensive monitoring in that catchment may locate the origin of human fecal contamination detected during this study."

                  Introduction
                  Approximately 66 million people with disabilities (PWD) live in Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite the important advances in regulations for social inclusion in this region, urban public spaces are not accessible to PWD. In this study, we assess street-level accessibility in the city of Cuenca (Ecuador) to examine the disparities for people with different mobility conditions.
               
                  Methods
                  We designed and implemented a mobile-based tool to audit street-level accessibility related to two key issues: the compliance level with the national standard for accessibility (NAMF) and the presence and characteristics of obstacles that hinder pedestrian mobility. A set of 214 street segments were audited by volunteers with different mobility conditions (unrestricted, restricted, or impaired). The collected data were analysed to compute accessibility indices (AIs) for each condition ranging from 0 (totally inaccessible) to 1 (totally accessible). AI values were examined to determine the differences among conditions.
               
                  Results
                  None of the 214 audited street segments fully complied with the NAMF. The AIs were: unrestricted mobility = 0.4, restricted mobility = 0.29, impaired mobility = 0.12. Eighty-three percent of the audited streets were perceived as highly inaccessible by wheelchair users, whereas for individuals with restricted or unrestricted mobility, the rates were 50% and 34%, respectively. Most streets were affected by obstacles that hindered mobility, with curb ramps and driveway ramps having the highest impact on accessibility.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The urban streets of Cuenca are highly inaccessible, mainly due to their flawed design and the presence of obstacles, creating excluding environments for people with mobility restrictions or impairments. National regulations are failing to tackle all the issues that hinder accessibility and must be revised. Cuenca, together with other intermediate cities in Latin America, must redesign their sidewalks and pedestrian facilities to allow universal accessibility.

Corruption, in its different forms of bribery, fraud, waste, collusion, and illicit financial flows, not only leads to waste but can also erode trust in government and public systems. Corruption is also complex and globalized with different forms of corruption occurring across different countries and multiple industries. One critical tool to leverage in the fight against corruption is the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning. Methods In this study, we deployed an unsupervised machine learning methodology using natural language processing to collect and analyze data from the popular social media platform Twitter with the aims of detecting self-reported experiences with corruption, including in the health sector. We collected data from the Twitter public API for keywords associated with corruption and used the biterm topic model to extract themes from the entire corpus of Tweets in order to detect user-generated messages reporting or discussing experiences with corruption. Results We analyzed 22, 180, 425 tweets filtered for corruption-related keywords from January–May 2019. Using a combination of NLP and manual annotation, we detected 2383 tweets from 1556 users that included self-reporting of corruption for two dominant themes: police bribery and healthcare corruption. Overall, we found a small number of users actively reporting experiences with corruption, identified users located in countries that are perceived as having higher levels of corruption by their citizens, and found that the majority of messages included reports of users’ own experiences and/or documentation of corruption. Conclusion Though technology is not a “silver bullet” that can entirely address the multifaceted nature of global corruption, this study demonstrates its potential utility as a force for good to enable better detection, characterize forms of corruption in different sectors, and hopefully inform future anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with shared goals of fighting corruption, improving population health, encouraging technology adoption, and fostering multistakeholder partnerships, may serve as a critical governance space to catalyze technology-driven anti-corruption approaches."

                  Agent-based social simulation has been comprehensively applied in the research of social and ecological systems. At its core is an artificial population, which endogenously drives the system evolution for particular applications, such as urban transportation, reginal economics, analysis of infectious disease transmission, and military simulation. In contrast with the previous population simulations where simple mathematical models are used to ‘reproduce’ actual demographic features, this paper proposes a self-evolutionary digital population system, named as Cognitive Artificial Population System (CAPS). At a more fine-grained level, CAPS focuses on the agent cognitive, reasoning and learning process in their surrounding environment, thus can exploit most advantages from cognitive computing and Artificial Intelligence. As a case study, Chinese population evolution is implemented using the proposed framework. Computational experiments indicate that CAPS is able to achieve good predicted population structures for real social systems.

The integration of these technologies will facilitate the techniques for better decision making and achieve urban growth. However, the existing traffic prediction methods mostly dedicated to highway and urban traffic management, and limited studies focused on collector roads and closed campuses. Besides, reaching out to the public, and establishing active connections to assist them in decision-making is challenging when the users are not equipped with any smart devices. This research proposes an IoT based system model to collect, process, and store real-time traffic data for such a scenario. The objective is to provide real-time traffic updates on traffic congestion and unusual traffic incidents through roadside message units and thereby improve mobility. These early-warning messages will help citizens to save their time, especially during peak hours. Also, the system broadcasts the traffic updates from the administrative authorities. A prototype is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of the model, and the results of the experiments show good accuracy in vehicle detection and a low relative error in road occupancy estimation. The study is part of the Omani-funded research project, investigating Real-Time Feedback for Adaptive Traffic Signals."

However, in big cities taxi service is still unbalanced, resulting in inefficiencies such as long waiting times and excessive vacant trips. This paper presents an exploratory taxi fleet service analysis and compares two forecast models aimed at predicting the spatiotemporal variation of short-term taxi demand. For this paper, we used a large sample with more than 1 million trips between 2014 and 2017, representing roughly 10% of Lisbon’s fleet. We analysed the spatiotemporal variation between pick-up and drop-off locations and how they are affected by weather conditions and points of interest. More, based on historic data, we built two models to predict the demand, ARIMA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and evaluated and compared the performance of both models. This study not only allows the direct comparison of a linear statistical model with a machine learning one, but also leads to a better comprehension of complex interactions surrounding different urban data sources using the taxi service as a probe to better understand urban mobility-on-demand and its needs."

Most chirality sensing is performed on stereocenters that are α (i.e., proximal) to the target functional group. Finding a general approach to detect more distant point chirality would increase the substrate scope of such assays. Herein, we demonstrate a design principle to “reach out” to more distant stereocenters, in this case β-chirality in primary alcohols. Therefore, we see the design principles established in this work as a step forward in sensing distant point chirality and, eventually, multi-stereocenter relationships."

                  While FOSS solutions have attracted a significant amount of attention, alongside with necessary and growing IT related expenditure for the digitalization of public administration, authorities face the question of whether migration to such solutions is feasible and/or worthwhile. The purpose of the presented work is to analyze existing domain research and extract key features, grouped in three major areas (namely Readiness, Ease of Use and Gain from migration), that should be investigated prior to a migration attempt. Following and building upon an extensive survey on Greek municipalities, the latter are categorized via the k-means non-supervised machine learning method to 3 levels of maturity regarding candidate participation in relevant projects. A combined scoring approach, based on similar features of the target FOSS solution as well as the aforementioned municipality categorization, is presented in order to detect a priori good candidate combinations (municipality and software) for minimizing a migration project risk. The method is validated through the aforementioned survey on municipalities with confirmed FOSS usage, indicating that selection in the proposed organized manner can aid in harvesting FOSS benefits. Furthermore, it is compared against a popular maturity model method (BPMMM) in order to comment on the applicability and classification process.

                  The public benefits of visible street greenery have been well recognised in a growing literature. Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery.

                  The appealing features of Cloud Computing continue to fuel its adoption and its integration in many sectors such industry, governments, education and entertainment. Nevertheless, uploading sensitive data to public cloud storage services poses security risks such as integrity, availability and confidentiality to organizations. Moreover, the open and distributed (decentralized) structure of the cloud has resulted this class of computing, prone to cyber attackers and intruders. Thereby, it is imperative to develop an anomaly network intrusion system to detect and prevent both inside and outside assaults in cloud environment with high detection precision and low false warnings. In this work, we propose an intelligent approach to build automatically an efficient and effective Deep Neural Network (DNN) based anomaly Network IDS using a hybrid optimization framework (IGASAA) based on Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA). The IDS resulted is called “MLIDS” (Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System). Genetic Algorithm (GA) is improved through optimization strategies, namely Parallel Processing and Fitness Value Hashing, which reduce execution time, convergence time and save processing power. Moreover, SAA was incorporated to IGA with the aim to optimize its heuristic search. Our approach consists of using IGASAA in order to search the optimal or near-optimal combination of most relevant values of the parameters included in construction of DNN based IDS or impacting its performance, like feature selection, data normalization, architecture of DNN, activation function, learning rate and Momentum term, which ensure high detection rate, high accuracy and low false alarm rate. For simulation and validation of the proposed method, CloudSim 4.0 simulator platform and three benchmark IDS datasets were used, namely CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD version 2015 and CIDDS-001. The implementation results of our model demonstrate its ability to detect intrusions with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate, and indicate its superiority in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

Then, how to realize the good layout of the financial market in the era of intelligence is an important problem facing all the countries in the world. We in the financial industry as the origin and change as the clue, analyzes the physical outlets as the representative of the financial institutions, banking as standard electronic banking and mobile phone to the bank as the representative of the mobile financial development of three major formats. On this basis, we analyze the current mobile phone terminal model of mobile banking three shortcomings, and propose the new mobile financial formats. This new format is tentatively known as “smart financial format”, it has the equipment personality, wearable, low carbon environmental protection, offline interaction, security, privacy and intelligence, efficiency, and other five major characteristics. In the future, the financial format is likely to be achieved by mobile financial formats to the upgrading of intelligent financial formats, to meet the needs of customers wider and deeper levels. The artificial intelligence method has its advantages in dealing with the problems of the economic system. Therefore, the introduction of artificial intelligence methods into the economic control will become a trend. The proposed model is validated through the public databases to verify the effectiveness.

                  This is a pioneering work in South America to model the exposure of cyclists to black carbon (BC) while riding in an urban area with high spatiotemporal variability of BC concentrations. We report on mobile BC concentrations sampled on 10 biking sessions in the city of Curitiba (Brazil), during rush hours of weekdays, covering four routes and totaling 178 km. Moreover, simultaneous BC measurements were conducted within a street canyon (street and rooftop levels) and at a site located 13 km from the city center. We used two statistical approaches to model the BC concentrations: multiple linear regression (MLR) and a machine-learning technique called random forests (RF). A pool of 25 candidate variables was created, including pollution measurements, traffic characteristics, street geometry and meteorology. The aggregated mean BC concentration within 30-m buffers along the four routes was 7.09 μg m−3, with large spatial variability (5th and 95th percentiles of 1.75 and 16.83 μg m−3, respectively). On average, the concentrations at the street canyon façade (5 m height) were lower than the mobile data but higher than the urban background levels. The MLR model explained a low percentage of variance (24%), but was within the values found in the literature for on-road BC mobile data. RF explained a larger variance (54%) with the additional advantage of having lower requirements for the target and predictor variables. The most impactful predictor for both models was the traffic rate of heavy-duty vehicles. Thus, to reduce the BC exposure of cyclists and residents living close to busy streets, we emphasize the importance of renewing and/or retrofitting the diesel-powered fleet, particularly public buses with old vehicle technologies. Urban planners could also use this valuable information to project bicycle lanes with greater separation from the circulation of heavy-duty diesel vehicles.

                  Deep learning using neural networks has provided advances in image style transfer, merging the content of one image (e.g., a photo) with the style of another (e.g., a painting). Our research shows this concept can be extended to analyse the design of streetscapes in relation to health and wellbeing outcomes. An Australian population health survey (n = 34,000) was used to identify the spatial distribution of health and wellbeing outcomes, including general health and social capital. For each outcome, the most and least desirable locations formed two domains. Streetscape design was sampled using around 80,000 Google Street View images per domain. Generative adversarial networks translated these images from one domain to the other, preserving the main structure of the input image, but transforming the ‘style’ from locations where self-reported health was bad to locations where it was good. These translations indicate that areas in Melbourne with good general health are characterised by sufficient green space and compactness of the urban environment, whilst streetscape imagery related to high social capital contained more and wider footpaths, fewer fences and more grass. Beyond identifying relationships, the method is a first step towards computer-generated design interventions that have the potential to improve population health and wellbeing.

                  Considering that government funding agencies make decisions on research and development (R&D) budget allocation to support an increasing number of research proposals, effective decision support systems are necessarily required. Motivated by the efforts of the Korean government, we propose a new decision support framework for allocating an R&D budget such that it maximizes the total expected R&D output. The proposed framework incorporates an R&D output prediction model with an optimization technique. We first employ a machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate future R&D output. Then, we apply a robust optimization technique to hedge against uncertainty in the predicted R&D output values. If not properly accounted for, this uncertainty may yield an inefficient budget allocation plan, thus hindering the operation of the R&D budgeting system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by applying it to a national R&D program conducted by the Korean government. Specifically, using the same budget, our budget allocation plan can achieve an output 13.6% greater than the actual R&D output. Thus, our model helps to attain allocation efficiency by systematically allocating budgets. We also observe the price of robustness when our model conservatively allocates budgets in order to hedge against uncertainty in the R&D predictions. Our findings offer insights for both policymakers and researchers related to designing better budget allocation systems for national R&D programs.

                  In a city or region, understanding the relationship between human mobility and socioeconomic status is critical to public policies formulation, urban design and marketing strategies development. Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework. Our findings and methods are helpful for modeling human mobility and assessing socioeconomic status.

The most distinctive elements in the urban landscape - categorised in paths, nodes, edges, districts and landmarks - give shape to individuals' mental representation of the city. Lynch’s approach has stimulated research into spatial cognition, urban design and artificial intelligence, and it still represents an essential pillar in the analysis of urban dynamics. Nevertheless, an explicit link between The Image of the City and GIScience has not been completely explored yet. In this paper, a computational approach to The Image of the City is proposed. Different perspectives in spatial cognition and GIS research are integrated to obtain a complete Image of the City, in which the most salient elements are shared by a large part of citizens. Nodes, paths and districts were identified through network science techniques. Methods drawn from the information approach to The Image of the City are used to detect landmarks, integrating the complexity of points of reference in their visual, structural and semantic components, as conceptualised by Lynch and successive research. The methods were applied to the central area of Boston and built using freely available spatial datasets. Results were compared to Lynch’s maps to evaluate the methodology: besides a considerable discrepancy with regard to landmarks, a good correspondence for paths, nodes, edges and districts was found."

                  To characterize the clinical presentation and hospital course of patients with reported synthetic cannabinoid (SC) exposure requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission.
               
                  Design
                  Retrospective case series of patients admitted to medical or cardiac ICU.
               
                  Setting
                  Urban tertiary care center.
               
                  Participants
                  Adults ≥18 years old admitted from the emergency department (ED) in 2015.
               
                  Measurements
                  Demographics, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and clinical parameters documenting the effects and hospital course.
               
                  Results
                  23 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 47 years (interquartile range [IQR], 32–54); 83% male; 78% black. Patients were generally tachycardic (HR > 100), (65%) and hypertensive (SBP > 140), (65%) on admission. The initial chest X-ray and ECG were abnormal in 43% and 68% of patients, respectively. Pulmonary edema and tachycardia were the most common findings. Head CT imaging was abnormal in 5% of patients. Troponin was elevated >1.0 ng/ml in 3 of 19 patients (16%). Other exposures detected on admission were marijuana (30%), alcohol (30%), and benzodiazepines (26%). The median SOFA score was 6 on admission and decreased over the next 3 days. SOFA scores were primarily driven by altered neurologic status and respiratory failure. 91% required mechanical ventilation, 30% had seizures as a part of presentation, 18% required vasopressors, and 5% needed dialysis. Median hospital and ICU lengths of stay were 2.6 (IQR 1.4–3.5) and 1.6 (IQR 0.9–2.5) days, respectively. The median hospital charge was $37,008. All patients survived the index hospitalization.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Patients admitted to ICU after SC exposure exhibit significant organ dysfunction, particularly neurologic and respiratory. Prognosis is good with supportive care.

                  This paper addressed how urban public spaces equipped with ICTs could be proper places for their users to learn. To find out the strategies of physical interventions for creating learning urban public spaces, the preferences of their users were derived by conducting interviews in the urban public spaces in the central part of Tehran. The results obtained from a deep survey with open (ended) questions suggested that the users of these public spaces were eager to learn in those spaces via ICTs and were more interested in displays than in any other types of ICTs moreover they gather at Wi-fi zones. The most important thing to learn in urban public places is knowledge, rather than skill or training, the knowledge which is related to the selected urban public spaces, their historical and cultural facts, and their management and participation issues rather than any other types. The most facilitating environmental conditions for learning are the places which have areas to seat or are equipped with seats, where users can gather and socialize easily, and which are not so crowded or empty, and the meeting points. Also, pre-experienced situations effect users’ interest in the use of a especial type of ICTs rather than the other types.
                  These findings inform urban designers, planners, policy makers and local municipality that some practical strategies used for physical interventions in these places for the purpose of creating learning public spaces would be the use of displays on the facades of buildings at different levels of pedestrian views, the installation of Wi-fi zones which have a supporting role to increase the number of learners, and the preparation of suitable seating furniture in the meeting points for long lasting learning.

                  A significant amount of administrator's summer planning is spent attempting to assign hundreds of students to teachers. These assignments must satisfy federal guidelines, parent preferences, and principal preferences while pursuing classroom parity and equity in regards to academic performance, behavioral support, and demographics. In addition, teachers are often the most invested in these decisions given the impact on their day-to-day life and their future performance evaluations. This problem is a variant of a standard problem in operations research; however, administrators often lack the technical expertise or budgets to build and/or implement such models. We present an open-source spreadsheet model-based DSS to this purpose. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program, present the implemented spreadsheet model interface, and illustrate on a set of student data. This DSS was implemented in the fall of 2018 for the assignment of close to 600 students to 24 classrooms saving dozens of staff and administration hours.
                  With minor adaptions and/or redefinitions, the DSS would provide similar value to many of the roughly 64,000 public primary and middle school principals across the country. Even more generally, the model as presented is a framework for developing and implementing an optimization-based DSS for assistance in creating project teams under a variety of potential preferences and constraints on team composition.

                  National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine-learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and sub-district availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.

We expect a future where transactions will be based on clouds and virtual machines, gathered from sensors and IoT devices and processed by different artificial intelligence algorithms or agents. The speed and backlash change in the world has driven researchers to work on privacy and security for entities’ information and transactions. Different concepts arise and still in their early stage as digital identity, self sovereign identity, global unique identifier and identity of things (IDoT). Therefore, motivated by the recent explosion of interest around Blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Identity Internet of Things (IDoT) sector. Blockchain a major distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact together without a need for a trusted third party, it actually make available many advantages to providers and consumers and solve data protection features lifelong a transaction existing. As being immutable, transparent and trustful platform the Blockchain allows managing identities and privacy of its nodes information. Our contribution is a new architecture eventually using a public Blockchain and creating a smart identity wallet. It contains standard node data and will also integrate proactive data behavior and the reactive one. The main target is to protect users from sybil attack at early stage. We will define a new digital wallet based on entities behavior in order to prevent 51% attack and Sybil attack"

Digital transformation is a functional use of web in design, manufacturing, marketing, selling, promotion and is data-oriented management model. Therefore, capabilities of firms are increased and their processes are improved. Digital technologies are developments regarding smartphones, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics systems, internet of things, 3D printing, virtualization, cyber security, sensor technologies, advanced robotics systems, automation and etc. which all is intensely used in many fields of economic and social life.SME’s consist of 99,83 % total enterprises, and 72,7 % of total employment, 50,6 % of total value added and provide 55,1 % of export, take an important role in economy. They should transform their organizational structures and business making cultures starting from manufacturing technologies to management percepts as to get a productive digital transformation process. The fact that SME’s being able to perform cost-benefit analysis of digital technologies and being aware of that technologies is significant.This paper provides a comprehensive view of the factors affecting digital transformation process and describes the digital transformation of the manufacturing sector in Turkey.The programs and softwares that SMEs can use to perform digital transformation, and can benefit from it, are explained. Empirical studies on SMEs shows that SMEs have erratic behaviors in terms of information and communications technology (ICT) investment and need external support to integrate digital transformations in the overall strategy of the firm."

In this study, national models were developed based on random forest algorithm, one of machine learning methods that is of high predictive capacity and able to provide interpretable results, to predict concentrations of PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) across the conterminous United States from 2005 to 2015 at the daily level. The random forest models achieved high out-of-bag (OOB) R2 values at the daily level, and the mean OOB R2 values were 0.86, 0.82, 0.71 and 0.75 for sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC, respectively, over 2005–2015. The long-term temporal trends of PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC predictions agreed well with their corresponding ground measurements. The annual mean of predicted PM2.5 sulfate and EC levels across the conterminous United States decreased substantially from 2005 to 2015; while concentrations of predicted PM2.5 nitrate and OC decreased and fluctuated during the study period. The annual prediction maps captured the characterized spatial patterns of the PM2.5 constituents. The distributions of annual mean concentrations of sulfate and nitrate were generally regional in the extent that sulfate decreased from east to west smoothly with enhancement in California and nitrate had higher concentration in Midwest, Metro New York area, and California. OC and EC had regional high concentrations in the Southeast and Northwest as well as localized high levels around urban centers. The spatial patterns of PM2.5 constituents were consistent with the distributions of their emission sources and secondary processes and transportation. Hence, the national models developed in this study could provide supplementary evaluations of spatio-temporal distributions of PM2.5 constituents with full time-space coverages in the conterminous United States, which could be beneficial to assess the impacts of PM2.5 constituents on radiation budgets and visibility degradation, and support exposure assessment for regional to national health studies at county or city levels to understand the acute and chronic toxicity and health impacts of PM2.5 constituents, and consequently provide scientific evidence for making targeted and effective regulations of PM2.5 pollution."

                  Experts remain divided about the nature of the sociopolitical system of ancient Teotihuacan, which was one of the earliest and largest urban civilizations of the Americas. Excavations hoping to find compelling evidence of powerful rulers, such as a royal tomb, keep coming away empty-handed. But the alternative possibility of collective rule still remains poorly understood as well. Previously we used a computational model of this city’s hypothetical sociopolitical network to show that in principle collective rule based on communal ritual could be an effective strategy of ensuring widespread social coordination, as long as we assume that the network’s structure could be transformed via social learning and local leaders were not strongly subdivided. Here we extended this model to investigate whether increased social hierarchy could mitigate the negative effects of such strong divisions. We found a special synergy between social hierarchy and communal ritual: only their combination improved the extent of social coordination, whereas the introduction of centralization and top-down influence by themselves had no effect. This finding is consistent with portrayals of the Teotihuacan elite as religious specialists serving the public good, in particular by synchronizing the city’s ritual calendar with the rhythms of the stars.

Most antineoplastic agents cause severe toxic effects and some types of cancer do not respond or are resistant to the existing pharmacotherapy, necessitating the research and development of new therapeutic strategies. Cardenolides have shown significant antitumor activity due to their ability to inhibit the Na+K+ATPase enzyme, and the expression of this enzyme is increased in tumor cells. Glucoevatromonoside containing peracetylated glucose hydroxyl groups (GEVPG) is a cardenolide derivative that has low solubility in aqueous media, which constitutes a barrier to its potential biological applications. In this context, the use of liposomes represents a promising strategy to deliver GEVPG, thus allowing its intravenous administration. In this study, long-circulating and fusogenic liposomes containing GEVPG (SpHL-GEVPG) were developed, and their chemical and physicochemical properties were evaluated. SpHL-GEVPG presented adequate properties, including a mean diameter of 182.2 ± 2.7 nm, a polydispersity index equal to 0.36 ± 0.03, a zeta potential of –2.37 ± 0.31 mV, and a GEVPG entrapment of 0.38 ± 0.04 mg/mL. Moreover, this formulation showed a good stability after having been stored for 30 days at 4 °C. The cytotoxic studies against breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SKBR-3) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines demonstrated that SpHL-GEVPG treatment significantly reduced the cell viability. In addition, the SpHL-GEVPG formulation presented a good selectivity toward these cancer cells. The evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with SpHL-GEVPG showed a potent anticancer effect in an A549 human lung cancer xenograft model. SpHL-GEVPG administered at doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg (i.v.) induced antitumor effect comparable to paclitaxel given at dose of 10 mg/kg (i.v.) to mice. Therefore, the results of the present work indicate the potential applicability of SpHL-GEVPG as a new anticancer formulation."

                  Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.

                  Many municipalities and public authorities have supported the creation of solar cadastres to map the solar energy-generation potential of existing buildings. Despite advancements in modelling solar potential, most of these tools provide simple evaluations based on benchmarks, neglecting the effect of uncertain environmental conditions and that of the spatial aggregation of multiple buildings. We argue that including such information in the evaluation process can lead to more robust planning decisions and a fairer allocation of public subsidies.
                  To this end, this paper presents a novel method to incorporate uncertainty in the evaluation of the solar electricity generation potential of existing buildings using a multi-scale approach. It also presents a technique to visualise the results through their integration in a 3D-mapping environment and the use of false-colour overlays at different scales.
                  Using multiple simulation scenarios, the method is able to provide information about confidence intervals of summary statistics of production due to variation in two typical uncertain factors: vegetation and weather. The uncertainty in production introduced by these factors is taken into account through pairwise comparisons of nominal values of indicators, calculating a comprehensive ranking of the energy potential of different spatial locations and a corresponding solar score. The analysis is run at different scales, using space- and time-aggregated results, to provide results relevant to decision-makers.

                  Background
                  Human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) asymptomatically infect the human population during childhood and establish latency in the host. Viral reactivation and urinary excretion can occur when the immune system is impaired. Exposure to particulate air pollution, including the PM10/PM2.5 components, is a public health problem and has been linked to several disorders. Studies assessing the relationship between PM10/PM2.5 exposure and viral replication are lacking.
               
                  Objectives
                  To investigate the relationship between HPyVs viruria and PM10/PM2.5 exposures.
               
                  Methods
                  Individual environmental exposure was assessed in 50 healthy adult volunteers using a chemical transport model (CTM) with a municipality resolution for daily PM10 and monitoring stations data for daily PM2.5 exposures. For each subject, a urine sample was collected, and HPyVs (JCPyV, BKPyV, MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7 and HPyV9) loads were determined. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression was used to model the count data, as it contained excessive zeros. Covariates were chosen by stepwise selection.
               
                  Results
                  HPyVs DNA was detected in 54% (median:87.6*105 copies/ml) of the urine samples. JCPyV was the prevalent (48%, (median viral load:126*105 copies/ml). Considering the load of the most frequently measured HPyVs, JCPyV, in the count-part of the ZINB model, every unitary in PM measured 2 days before urine collection (PM Day −2) was associated with an increase in JCPyV load (PM10: +4.0%, p-value = 0.002; PM2.5: +3.6%, p-value = 0.005). In the zero-part, the significant predictor was the PM10 measured 5 days before urine collection (+3%, p-value = 0.03).
               
                  Conclusions
                  The environmental levels of PM10/PM2.5 increase the JCPyV viruria. Our findings emphasize the need for studies assessing the influence of air pollution exposure on the risk of viral reactivation.

                  Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a serious global public health problem and lately very few antibiotics have been discovered and introduced into clinical practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of antibacterial compounds with new mechanism of action, especially those capable of evading known resistance mechanisms. In this work two series of glycoconjugate and non-glycoconjugate amino compounds derived from of isoquinoline-5,8-dione and 1,4-naphthoquinone and their halogenated derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. simulans ATCC 27851) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 15290, K. pneumoniae ATCC 4352 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) strains of clinical importance. This study revealed that glycoconjugate compounds derived from halogeno-substituted naphthoquinones were more active against Gram-negative strains, which cause infections whose treatment is even more difficult, according to the literature. These molecules were also more active than isoquinoline-5,8-dione analogues with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC = 4–32 μg/mL) within Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute MIC values (CLSI 0.08–256 μg/mL). Interestingly the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of the most active compounds were equal to MIC classifying them as bactericidal agents against Gram-negative bacteria. Sixteen compounds among eighteen carbohydrate-based naphthoquinones tested showed no hemolytic effects on health human erythrocytes whereas more susceptibility to hemolytic cleavage was observed when using non-glycoconjugate amino compounds. In silico Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) evaluation also pointed out that these compounds are potential for oral administration with low side effects. In general, this study indicated that these compounds should be exploited in the search for a leading substance in a project aimed at obtaining new antimicrobials more effective against Gram-negative bacteria.

                  Prior research has shown that land use patterns and the spatial configurations of cities have a significant impact on residential energy demand. Given the pressing issues surrounding energy security and climate change, there is renewed interest in developing and retrofitting cities to make them more energy efficient. Yet deriving micro-scale residential energy footprints of metropolitan areas is challenging because high resolution data from energy providers is generally unavailable. In this study, a bottom-up model is proposed to estimate residential energy demand using datasets that are commonly available in the United States. The model applies novel machine learning methods to match records in the Residential Energy Consumption Survey with Public Use Microdata samples. This matching and machine learning produce a synthetic household energy distribution at a neighborhood scale. The model was tested and validated with data from the Atlanta metropolitan region to demonstrate its application and promise.

Such framework combines the versatile WiSARD classifier with a set of rules defined a priori, resulting in a neuro-symbolic learning system with very interesting characteristics and cutting-edge performance. We also verified the influence of different binarization methods in order to adapt raw data to WiSARD, which feeds from binary data only. These ideas were tested against a large data set of trajectories of buses from the city of Rio de Janeiro. The results confirm the practical applicability of those, since the accomplished performance was as good as that of other state-of-the-art rival methods in most test scenarios.

                  Objective
                  To determine whether trace amounts of ethylene glycol (EG), diethylene glycol (DEG), or triethylene glycol (TEG) in PEG 3350 are associated with increased blood levels of EG, DEG, or TEG in children receiving daily PEG 3350 therapy.
               
                  Study design
                  Blood samples were drawn from 9 children who were being treated for constipation with PEG 3350 (6-12 years old) before and every 30 minutes for 3 hours after receiving 17 g of PEG 3350. PEG 3350, tap water, and blood samples from 18 age- and sex-matched controls also were analyzed.
               
                  Results
                  Baseline blood levels of EG and TEG did not differ between control and treated groups. DEG levels (median [IQR]) were lower in the PEG 3350 group (40.13 ng/mL [36.69, 63.94] vs 92.83 ng/mL [51.06, 128.93], P = .008). After PEG 3350 dose, levels of EG (390.51 ng/mL [326.06, 624.55]) and TEG (2.21 ng/mL [0, 4.5]) peaked at 90 minutes at 1032.81 ng/mL (826.84, 1486.13) (P = .009) and 35.17 ng/mL (15.81, 45.13) (P = .0005), respectively. DEG levels did not significantly change. Standard 17-g doses of PEG 3350 in 8 oz (237 mL) of water resulted in concentrations (mean ± SD) of EG, DEG, and TEG of 1.32 ± 0.23 µg/mL, 0.18 ± 0.03 µg/mL, and 0.12 ± 0.01 µg/mL, respectively. EG, DEG, and TEG levels in public water supply were 0.07 µg/mL, 0.21 µg/mL, and 0.02 µg/mL, respectively.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Daily PEG 3350 therapy in children was not associated with sustained elevation of EG, DEG, or TEG blood levels over levels in matched controls. Although EG and TEG levels increased after a standard dose of PEG 3350, their peak values remained well below toxic levels.

                  This paper discusses how local governments can team up for joint service provision, be more adaptive towards new technological and organisational changes and introduce novel services following main industry trends (e.g. predictive analytics, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence). The conceptual approach is to use Public Value (PV) as the framework for the organisation and management of government performance, one of the most important successor ‘paradigmettes’ of the New Public Management (NPM). Based on the PV concept, the ‘adaptive model’ for local governments is introduced according to which each procured ICT solution is preceded by agile, open, bottom-up and experimental trial. This model is corroborated via recent empirical evidence from the case of Helsinki and Tallinn which was obtained by observing how city governments collaborate on joint innovation-lab-type structures and conduct agile trials in the field of smart mobility before traditional procurement.

                      week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building’s schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building’s load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.

                  This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based model, called ANN-2Day model, for forecasting, managing and ultimately eliminating the growing risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks. The ANN-2Day model was developed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Toolbox in MATLAB Program and 15-years of epidemiological and environmental data for six independent environmental predictors including water temperature, solar radiation, gage height, salinity, wind, and rainfall. It was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks can be forecasted with two-day lead time using the ANN-2Day model and daily data of the six environmental predictors. Forecasting results of the ANN-2Day model indicated that the model was capable of reproducing 19years of historical oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast with the positive predictive value of 76.82%, the negative predictive value of 100.00%, the sensitivity of 100.00%, the specificity of 99.84%, and the overall accuracy of 99.83%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the ANN-2Day model in predicting the risk of norovirus outbreaks to human health. The 2-day lead time enables public health agencies and oyster harvesters to plan for management interventions and thus makes it possible to achieve a paradigm shift of their daily management and operation from primarily reacting to epidemic incidents of norovirus infection after they have occurred to eliminating (or at least reducing) the risk of costly incidents.

These studies show that this sector lacks appropriate adaptation strategies due to the complexity of the analysed systems and interrelations between a number of socio-economic and environmental variables. The present study designed a decision support system to identify adaptation strategies for wine farms undergoing climate change. The tool allows for the analysis of a wine farm's economic performance when it adopts measures to cope with climatic variability. Average values for climate change and extreme events were considered to assess different scenarios. A mix-method approach was applied to integrate probability calculations, complex system analyses and operational research (a metaheuristic approach). The model was tested on a case study located in central Italy (Chianti Classico). To maintain and improve future financial performance, organic farming and adjustments to procedural guidelines were recommended as key strategies. Economic variables, such as the average price of wine, seem to have a strong influence on farms' implementation of adaptive measures. An additional result seems to suggest that insurance schemes in areas producing high quality wine are only suitable when low-level deductibles and public funding are available. The present work shows that the decision support system favours analytical sensitivity to different scenarios and variables related to climate change as well as to socio-economic shifts in the viticulture sector.

Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as ‘where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration’ and ‘in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing’. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents."

                  Serial crimes pose a great threat to public security. Linking crimes committed by the same offender can assist the detecting of serial crimes and is of great importance in maintaining public security. Currently, most crime analysts still link serial crimes empirically especially in China and desire quantitative tools to help them. This paper presents a decision support system for crime linkage based on various, including behavioral, features of criminal cases. Its underlying technique is pairwise classification based on similarity, which is interpretable and easy to tune. We design feature similarity algorithms to calculate the pairwise similarities and build up a classifier to determine whether a case pair should belong to a series. A comprehensive case study of a real-world robbery dataset demonstrates its promising performance even with the default setting. This system has been deployed in a public security bureau of China and running for more than one year with positive feedback from users. The use of this system would provide individual officers with strong support in crimes investigation then allow law enforcement agency to save resources, since the system not only can link serial crimes automatically based on a classification model learned from historical crime data, but also has flexibility in training data update and domain experts interaction, including adjusting the key components like similarity matrices and decision thresholds to reach a good tradeoff between caseload and number of true linked pairs.

An early warning system based on accurate forecasting tools must therefore be implemented to circumvent the adverse effects of exposure to major air pollutants. A multilayer perceptron neural network was trained and developed using air pollution and meteorological data over a two-year period from a monitoring site in Marylebone Road, Central London to predict roadside concentration values of NO2 24 hours ahead. Several hybrid models were also developed by applying feature selection techniques such as stepwise regression, principal component analysis, and Classification and Regression Trees to the neural network model. Most roadside pollutant variables, e.g., oxides of nitrogen, were found to be significant in predicting NO2. The statistical results reveal overall prediction superiority of the hybrid models to the standalone neural network model."

                  Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance—good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and “interpretability”. Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of “regional centers” (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders—to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand.

                  Introduction
                  Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants classified among endocrine disruptors and human carcinogens. In an urban area in Northern Italy (Brescia), a chemical factory producing PCBs from 1938 to 1984 caused soil and food pollution. Since the discovering of the environmental pollution in the area in 2001, various public health interventions have been implemented to avoid human contamination.
               
                  Methods
                  Two independent surveys were carried out in 2003 and 2013 using the same study design and methods. A random sample of the adult general population living in four areas of the town with different soil contamination level was enrolled in both surveys. Investigation included serum levels of 24 PCB congeners and of other common clinical-chemical parameters and questions about residential and occupational history as well as current and past diet and consumption of locally produced food. 537 subjects were tested in the 2003 and 488 in the 2013 survey.
               
                  Results
                  Total PCB serum levels showed a strong correlation with age (Spearman r=0.71 in 2003 and r=0.80 in 2013), but not with gender. Consumers of food produced in the most polluted area had higher total PCB serum levels (median 15.6 and 4.7ng/ml in 2003 and 2013, respectively) than non-consumers (4.1 and 2.3ng/ml) and consumers of food produced in non-polluted areas (6.5 and 1.9ng/ml), with increasing trend of PCB serum levels with cumulative local food intake. PCB serum levels from 2003 to 2013 survey declined by around half in all age groups, especially among the youngest people. The total PCB reduction was found to be due to a combination of a birth cohort effect (−41% every 10years) and survey period effect (−18% in 2013 versus 2003), with medium chlorinated CB congeners showing the most relevant reduction (−30%) between the two surveys. High chlorinated CBs were more strongly associated with birth cohort (−46% every 10years): in the 2013 survey they represented 58% of total PCBs in 60–79years old while they were 37% among the under 40s with a median value 20 times higher in the oldest than in the youngest (3.1 versus 0.16ng/ml).
               
                  Conclusions
                  PCBs serum levels declined from the 2003 to 2013 survey though they are still high in the elderly mainly because of past intake of locally produced contaminated food. Present findings suggest that PCBs food chain contamination and human absorption have been interrupted successfully in the area since discovery of the pollution in 2001.

                  Malaria transmission is a serious emergence in urban and semiurban areas worldwide, becoming a major international public health concern. Malaria is transmitted through the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. The extensive employ of synthetic pesticides leads to negative effects on human health and the environment. Recently, plant-synthesized nanoparticles have been proposed as highly effective mosquitocides. In this research, we synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using the Azadirachta indica seed kernel extract as reducing and stabilizing agent. AgNP were characterized by UV–vis spectrophotometry, SEM, EDX, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. The A. indica seed kernel extract was toxic against Anopheles stephensi larvae and pupae, LC50 were 232.8ppm (larva I), 260.6ppm (II), 290.3ppm (III), 323.4ppm (IV), and 348.4ppm (pupa). AgNP LC50 were 3.9ppm (I), 4.9ppm (II), 5.6ppm (III), 6.5ppm (IV), and 8.2ppm (pupa). The antiplasmodial activity of A. indica seed kernel extract and AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of A. indica seed kernel extract were 63.18μg/ml (CQ-s) and 69.24μg/ml (CQ-r). A. indica seed kernel-synthesized AgNP achieved IC50, of 82.41μg/ml (CQ-s) and 86.12μg/ml (CQ-r). However, in vivo anti-plasmodial experiments conducted on Plasmodium berghei infecting albino mice showed moderate activity of the A. indica extract and AgNP. Overall, this study showed that the A. indica-mediated fabrication of AgNP is of interest for a wide array of purposes, ranging from IPM of mosquito vectors to the development of novel and cheap antimalarial drugs.

                  Estuarine waters are usually eutrophic due to nutrients input derived from natural and anthropogenic sources. In the Caeté Estuary, nutrients and thermotolerant coliforms input is intensified by the absence of a public sanitation system and by mangrove outwelling. This input is more accentuated in the upper sector of the estuary where 90% of the local population is concentrated and a high incidence of commercial activities (public markets, ice factories and boat repairing among others) is located. As a consequence, eutrophic waters with high concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms (up to 1100 MPN/100 ml) were observed during the dry season when dilution and/or advection are less effective. Eutrophication, though less pronounced, also occurred in the other sectors (middle and lower), but these results seem to indicate that this could be a natural condition of an Amazon region which is naturally enriched with a high amount of nutrients. On the other hand, nutrient concentration values in the upper sector are similar to those found in other highly populated and industrialized Brazilian estuaries. Taking into account that the population increases by about 20% per decade in the region, this growth may lead to a significant increase in human pressure and impacts on the area, mainly during periods when the estuary is more susceptible to retaining nutrients (e.g., during the dry season). In order to improve water quality, the DPSIR framework was used as a guide for proposing potential measures to be implemented in the Caeté Estuary based on (i) urban planning to control sewage discharges, (ii) construction of water treatment infrastructures to reduce untreated effluents inputs and (iii) water use regulations as a function of the current water quality.

                  Tropospheric ozone is a major air pollution problem, both for public health and for the environment, which is not directly emitted by human activities. It is a secondary pollutant, which produces due to reaction with volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide concentrations, both emitted by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, ozone episode has been studied in Delhi, the urban area, where anthropogenic emissions are playing major role in ambient air pollution. The 8-hourly analysis of past data pattern in each season at different monitoring stations in Delhi suggests that the ozone episodes were occurred approximately 31% of the total observations and the summer seasons is the worst performer of ozone concentrations in Delhi. The correlation matrix shows that the dew point temperature, NO2, and relative humidity are the dominating variables for Ozone (O3) concentrations in Delhi. The present study aimed to analyze the ozone episodes in a year and to develop the artificial intelligence based forecasting methodologies over Delhi megacity. Further, the hourly ozone forecasting models have been developed through different modeling techniques, e.g., multiple linear regressions (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and artificial intelligence based Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) techniques. The air pollutants as well as meteorological parameters have been used to analyze the ozone episodes. The forecasted results from different models are compared with the observed values with statistical measures, e.g., correlation coefficients (R), normalized mean square error (NMSE), fractional bias (FB) and index of agreement (IOA). The performed statistical analysis has indicated that the artificial intelligence implementations have a more reasonable agreement with the observed values.

                  Portable digital devices equipped with GPS antennas are ubiquitous sources of continuous information for location-based Expert and Intelligent Systems. The availability of these traces on the human mobility patterns is growing explosively. To mine this data is a fascinating challenge which can produce a big impact on both travelers and transit agencies.
                  This paper proposes a novel incremental framework to maintain statistics on the urban mobility dynamics over a time-evolving origin-destination (O-D) matrix. The main motivation behind such task is to be able to learn from the location-based samples which are continuously being produced, independently on their source, dimensionality or (high) communicational rate. By doing so, the authors aimed to obtain a generalist framework capable of summarizing relevant context-aware information which is able to follow, as close as possible, the stochastic dynamics on the human mobility behavior. Its potential impact ranges Expert Systems for decision support across multiple industries, from demand estimation for public transportation planning till travel time prediction for intelligent routing systems, among others.
                  The proposed methodology settles on three steps: (i) Half-Space trees are used to divide the city area into dense subregions of equal mass. The uncovered regions form an O-D matrix which can be updated by transforming the trees’leaves into conditional nodes (and vice-versa). The (ii) Partioning Incremental Algorithm is then employed to discretize the target variable’s historical values on each matrix cell. Finally, a (iii) dimensional hierarchy is defined to discretize the domains of the independent variables depending on the cell’s samples.
                  A Taxi Network running on a mid-sized city in Portugal was selected as a case study. The Travel Time Estimation (TTE) problem was regarded as a real-world application. Experiments using one million data samples were conducted to validate the methodology. The results obtained highlight the straightforward contribution of this method: it is capable of resisting to the drift while still approximating context-aware solutions through a multidimensional discretization of the feature space. It is a step ahead in estimating the real-time mobility dynamics, regardless of its application field.

Design Randomized controlled trial; phase-I and phase-II studies. Setting University and public hospitals. Patient(s) Women aged ≥18 years who wanted to receive an IUD. Four women were parous in phase I; all in phase II were nulliparous. Intervention(s) A single, 8.5-mL dose of lidocaine formulation (SHACT) was administered (to the portio, cervix, and uterus) with a specially designed applicator. Main Outcome Measure(s) The phase-I study (single-arm) was designed for pharmacokinetic assessment; the phase-II study (randomized) was intended for investigation of efficacy and safety. Result(s) From the phase-I study (15 participants), mean pharmacokinetic values were: maximum plasma concentration: 351 ± 205 ng/mL; time taken to reach maximum concentration: 68 ± 41 minutes; and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 180 minutes: 717 ± 421 ng*h/mL. Pain relief was observed with lidocaine vs. placebo in the phase-II study (218 women, randomized). Mean visual analog scale score for maximum pain during the first 10 minutes after IUD insertion was 36% lower with lidocaine than with placebo (28.3 ± 24.6 vs. 44.2 ± 26.0). Pain intensity was also significantly lower in the lidocaine group at 30 minutes. On average, 3 of 4 patients will have less pain with lidocaine than with placebo. Adverse events were similar in the placebo and lidocaine groups. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion(s) Lidocaine provides pain relief lasting for 30–60 minutes for women undergoing IUD insertion, without any safety concerns. Further studies of this lidocaine formulation, for IUD insertion and other clinical applications, are planned. Clinical Trial Registration Number 2011-005660-18 and 2011-006220-20 (EudraCT)."

                  Urban Bicycles Renting Systems (UBRS) are becoming a common and useful component in growing modern cities. For an efficient management and support, the UBRS infrastructure requires the optimation of vehicle routes connecting several bicycle base stations and storage centers. In this study, we model this real-world optimization problem as a capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with multiple depots and the simultaneous need for pickup and delivery at each base station location. Based on the VRP model specification, two nature-inspired computational techniques, evolutionary algorithms and ant colony systems, are presented and their performance in tackling the UBRS problem is investigated. In the evolutionary approach, individuals are encoded as permutations of base stations and then translated to a set of routes subject to the constraints related to vehicle capacity and node demands. In the ant-based approach, ants build complete solutions formed of several subtours servicing a subset of base stations using a single vehicle based on both apriori (the attractiveness of a move based on the known distance or other factors) and aposteriori (pheromone levels accumulated on visited edges) knowledge. Both algorithms are engaged for the UBRS problem using real data from the cities of Barcelona and Valencia. Computational experiments for several scenarios support a good performance of both population-based search methods. Comparative results indicate that better solutions are obtained on the average by the ant colony system approach for both considered cities.

                  Protozoan parasites have been one of the most significant public health problems for centuries and several human infections caused by them have massive global impact. Most of the current drugs used to treat these illnesses have been used for decades and have many limitations such as the emergence of drug resistance, severe side-effects, low-to-medium drug efficacy, administration routes, cost, etc. These drugs have been largely neglected as models for drug development because they are majorly used in countries with limited resources and as a consequence with scarce marketing possibilities. Nowadays, there is a pressing need to identify and develop new drug-based antiprotozoan therapies. In an effort to overcome this problem, the main purpose of this study is to develop a QSARs-based ensemble classifier for antiprotozoan drug-like entities from a heterogeneous compounds collection. Here, we use some of the TOMOCOMD-CARDD molecular descriptors and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to derive individual linear classification functions in order to discriminate between antiprotozoan and non-antiprotozoan compounds as a way to enable the computational screening of virtual combinatorial datasets and/or drugs already approved. Firstly, we construct a wide-spectrum benchmark database comprising of 680 organic chemicals with great structural variability (254 of them antiprotozoan agents and 426 to drugs having other clinical uses). This series of compounds was processed by a k-means cluster analysis in order to design training and predicting sets. In total, seven discriminant functions were obtained, by using the whole set of atom-based linear indices. All the LDA-based QSAR models show accuracies above 85% in the training set and values of Matthews correlation coefficients (
                        C
                     ) vary from 0.70 to 0.86. The external validation set shows rather-good global classifications of around 80% (92.05% for best equation). Later, we developed a multi-agent QSAR classification system, in which the individual QSAR outputs are the inputs of the aforementioned fusion approach. Finally, the fusion model was used for the identification of a novel generation of lead-like antiprotozoan compounds by using ligand-based virtual screening of ‘available’ small molecules (with synthetic feasibility) in our ‘in-house’ library. A new molecular subsystem (quinoxalinones) was then theoretically selected as a promising lead series, and its derivatives subsequently synthesized, structurally characterized, and experimentally assayed by using in vitro screening that took into consideration a battery of five parasite-based assays. The chemicals 11(12) and 16 are the most active (hits) against apicomplexa (sporozoa) and mastigophora (flagellata) subphylum parasites, respectively. Both compounds depicted good activity in every protozoan in vitro panel and they did not show unspecific cytotoxicity on the host cells. The described technical framework seems to be a promising QSAR-classifier tool for the molecular discovery and development of novel classes of broad—antiprotozoan—spectrum drugs, which may meet the dual challenges posed by drug-resistant parasites and the rapid progression of protozoan illnesses.

However, wind forecasts, and in particular daily peak wind gust forecasts, provide the public with a general sense of the risks associated with wind on a given day and are useful in decision making. Additionally, such knowledge is critical for wind energy production. Currently, no operational daily peak wind gust product exists. As such, this project will seek to develop a peak wind gust prediction scheme based on output from an operational numerical weather prediction model. Output from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model will be used in a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm trained to predict daily peak wind gusts for ten cities commonly impacted by hazardous wind gusts (cities in the Midwest and central Plains) and with interests in wind energy. Output from a kernel principal component analysis of the fully three-dimensional atmosphere as characterized by the NAM forecasts will be used to predict peak wind gusts for each location at 36hours lead time. Ultimately, this initial product will lead to the development of a more robust prediction scheme that could one day transition into an operational forecast model."

                  Dominant global patterns of urbanization and industrialization contribute to large-scale modification of the drivers for hydrologic and biogeochemical processes, as evident in Asia, Africa, and South America which are experiencing rapid population and economic growth. One manifestation of urbanization and economic development is decreases in air quality, increases in dry/wet deposition fluxes, and growing adverse impacts on public health and ecosystem integrity. We examined available long-term (1980–2010) observational data, gathered at weekly intervals, for wet deposition at 19 urban sites in the U.S., and monitoring data (2000–2009) available for 17 urban sites at a monthly scale in East Asia. Our analyses are based on data for four constituents (SO4
                     2−, NO3
                     −, Ca2+, and Mg2+); differences in atmospheric chemistry and terrestrial sources of these constituents enabled a robust comparative analysis. We examined intra-annual variability and the long-term temporal trajectories of wet deposition fluxes to discern the relative role of anthropogenic and stochastic hydro-climatic forcing. Here, we show that: (1) temporal variability in wet deposition fluxes follows an exponential probability density function at all sites, evidence that stochasticity of rainfall is the dominant control of wet deposition variability; (2) the mean wet deposition flux, μ
                     Ω (ML−2T−1), has decreased in the U.S. over time since enactment of the Clean Air Act, with μ
                     Ω having become homogenized across varying hydro-climatic regimes; and (3) in contrast, μ
                     Ω values for East Asian cities are 3–10 times higher than U.S. cities, attributed to lax regulatory enforcement. Based on the observed patterns, we suggest a stochastic model that generates ellipses within which the μ
                     Ω temporal trajectories are inscribed. In the U.S., anthropogenic forcing (regulations) is dominant in the humid regions, while variability in hydro-climatic forcing explains inter-annual variability in arid regions. Our stochastic analysis facilitates projections of the temporal trajectory shifts in wet deposition fluxes as a result of urbanization and other land-use changes, climate change, and regulatory enforcement.

Initiatives such as the Building Information Model (BIM), Industry Founda- tion Classes (IFC), and CityGML are creating the information-theoretic backbone that guides the crucial aspects of quality, exchange, and interoperability of spatial data at the environmental and urban scale. However, due to the inherent scale, com- plexity, and detailed geometric character of building information data, extracting useful semantic and qualitative knowledge for accomplishing high-level analytical tasks is still an extremely complex and error prone process involving data intensive computing. We propose a uniform spatial data access middleware that can provide a combination of high-level, multi-modal, semantic, and quantitative-qualitative spatial data access and analytical capability. We present the core computational capabil- ities for the proposed middleware and present an overview of the high-level spatial model and its compliance with the industry standard IFC. A key theoretical contribution is a framework for investigating the computational complexity of deriving spatial artefacts within the context of building informatics. Additionally, we empirically investigate the feasibility and practicality of the derivation of spatial artefacts by conducting experiments on seven industry-scale IFC models. The experiment results show that, despite having non-linear polynomial increase with respect to time, deriving spatial artefacts is practical with large designs."

                  Realgar (As4S4) is a traditional medicine used in China and Europe for thousands of years. As an arsenical, the toxicity from realgar has raised public concern. Several organic acids in urine are found to be potential biomarkers of realgar exposure, including taurine, citric, glutamic, lactic, pyruvic, succinic and uric acid. In this study, using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS), a rapid and sensitive method was developed to separate and quantify these compounds in urine. A ZIC®-HILIC column was used for the separation at an isocratic condition of acetonitrile and 10mM ammonium acetate in water. Analytes were detected in multiple-reaction monitoring with negative ionization mode, using ibuprofen as internal standard. Good line arities (R
                     2
                     >0.996) were obtained for all analytes with the limits of detection from 0.2 to 0.7μg/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy ranged from 89.1 to 104.4% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) did not exceed 15.0%. The recovery was more than 80%with RSD less than 14.0%. The validated method was applied to analyze the urine samples of control and reaglar treated rats, and significant changes of these organic acids were observed.

                  Biosurveillance systems designed and deployed in the United States and abroad to allow public health authorities to monitor the health of their communities have significant design limitations despite their wide usage. One limitation is the lack of algorithmic solutions to combine local data sources for regional situation awareness. The objective of the current study is to develop and demonstrate the value of automated information fusion methods applied to the distributed neighboring public health sites. A prototype system consisting of distributed Bayesian models was designed to enable informed regional and local cognitive decision support response. The Intelligent Decision Support Network (IDSN) is composed of Bayesian Information Fusion Models (BIFMs) that target a particular syndrome or disease type. Using local data from county health departments in Northern Virginia for the time period between August 2005 and May 2007, we estimated the probability of a gastrointestinal (GI) outbreak in two ways: First, based on data from the local hospitals only; and second, based on the relative probability of outbreak by combining local hospital data and probabilities of GI events from the neighboring counties’ BIFMs. Preliminary findings showed that the network of distributed models detected events that would be undetected without multi-jurisdictional data.

                  To investigate the occurrence of premature progesterone rise (PPR) in GnRH agonist long or short protocol, address the relationship between circulating P levels and live birth rates, and explore the possible mechanism through which PPR affects clinical outcomes and the possible factors related to the occurrence of PPR.

                  None.
               
                  Main Outcome Measure(s)
                  Live birth rates.
               
                  Result(s)
                  The corresponding incidence of PPR in long or short protocol was 22.86% (393/1,719) or 27.63% (234/847) with the cutoff value of 1.2 ng/mL or 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, being used to define PPR. Live birth rates decreased under the condition of PPR (40.65% vs. 29.77% in long protocol; 30.18% vs. 23.50% in short protocol). Logistic regression analysis showed that serum P level on the day of hCG administration was a strong predictor of live birth rate in both long and short protocols. Live birth rates in frozen embryo transfer cycles had no significant difference between groups with or without PPR (29.31% vs. 25.35% in long protocol; 24.84% vs. 24.22% in short protocol). Multivariate regression analysis showed that exogenous gonadotropin dose, the duration of stimulation, E2 and LH levels on the day of hCG administration, the number of oocytes retrieved, and basal FSH level were all involved in PPR.
               
                  Conclusion(s)
                  In GnRH agonist cycles, PPR negatively correlated with live birth rate in fresh embryo transfer cycles, although no adverse impact on frozen embryo transfer was observed, implying that PPR may have deleterious effects on endometrial receptivity.

                  The paper presents valuing of qualitative and quantitative travel attributes influencing the attractiveness of suburban train service in Mumbai city, India. A stated preference experiment is designed to capture the data of sub-urban train mode choice behavior. The behavioral data are analyzed using different modeling techniques such as multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (ML). In ML model, the random parameters are assumed to follow constrained triangular distribution, where mean equals its spread. The decomposition of preference heterogeneity around the mean estimate of random parameter is also investigated using ML model. The study shows the influence of headway time and train ride time associated with a particular crowding level (expressed in density of standing passengers/m2) in choosing the sub-urban train mode by calculating their willingness-to-pay (WTP) values and highlights the importance of WTP for addressing policy issues in the reduction of in-vehicle crowding level. The present study documents new findings of the effect of crowding level on train ride time in the context of a developing country and suggests some important directions for future suburban train transport crowding valuation research.

                  In this paper we review progress towards the implementation of a risk management framework for US federal wildland fire policy and operations. We first describe new developments in wildfire simulation technology that catalyzed the development of risk-based decision support systems for strategic wildfire management. These systems include new analytical methods to measure wildfire risk to human and ecological values and to inform fuel treatment investment strategies at national, regional, and local scales. Application of the risk management framework to support wildfire incidents has been dramatically advanced with the Wildland Fire Decision Support System and allowed policy modifications that encourage management of incidents for multiple objectives. The new wildfire risk management decision support systems we discuss provide Federal agencies in the US the ability to integrate risk-informed approaches to a wide range of wildfire management responsibilities and decisions. While much progress has been made, there remain several barriers that need to be addressed to fully integrate risk science into current wildfire management practices. We conclude by identifying five primary issues that if properly addressed could help public land management better realize the opportunities and potential payoffs from fully adopting a risk management paradigm.

                  Clean water has become one of the main limiting factors in agricultural food production in Europe, especially for countries around the Mediterranean, who now face more severe and frequent seasonal water shortages. In order to overcome water shortages the European Water Framework Directive encourages and promotes the use of treated urban wastewater in agriculture. However, the use of poor quality water in agriculture poses potential health risks. The application of wastewater through subsurface drip irrigation lines could possibly overcome public health concerns by minimizing contact with wastewater by farmers, farm workers but it is uncertain if the risk for consumers of wastewater irrigated produces would be acceptable. The objective of the current study was therefore to assess whether subsurface irrigation of potatoes with low quality water was associated with higher food safety and reduced human health risks as compared with surface irrigation. The microbial quality of soil and potatoes irrigated by sprinkler, furrow and subsurface drip irrigation, using treated urban wastewater, canal water and tap water were compared at experimental sites near Belgrade, Serbia and in Bologna, Italy. Water, soil and potato samples were collected from March 2007 to September 2008 and their faecal contamination estimated by enumeration of the faecal indicator Escherichia coli. In addition, water and potatoes in Italy were analysed for the presence of helminth eggs, another important indicator of faecal pollution. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model combined with Monte Carlo simulations was used to assess whether the different irrigation practices and associated health risks complied with guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO). The study found low levels of E. coli in irrigation water (Italy mean value: 1.7 colony forming units (cfu)/ml and Serbia 11cfu/ml), as well as in soil (Italy mean: 1.0cfu/g and Serbia 1.1cfu/g). Similar low concentrations of E. coli were found on potatoes (Italy mean: 1.0cfu/g and Serbia 0.0cfu/g). The vast majority (442/516) of the collected different samples were free of E. coli. No helminth eggs were found in any types of irrigation water or on the surface of potatoes. The risk assessment models found the use of treated wastewater to exceed the levels of risks for gastro-intestinal disease (1.0×10−3 disease risk) as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the accidental ingestion of soil by farmers (Serbia: 0.22 and Italy: 5.7×10−2). However, samples that exceeded disease risks set by the WHO were collected before initiation of wastewater irrigation and were limited to a few numbers of samples, which would indicate environmental contamination not linked to irrigation practice. Disease risk from consumption of potatoes in Italy and in Serbia was found to be within acceptable levels. No relationship was found between E. coli concentrations in irrigation water, soil and produce. Similar lack of association was found for E. coli findings in sprinkler, furrow or subsurface drip irrigated soils and produce. This indicates that subsurface drip irrigation can be practiced while ensuring food safety and protecting the health of consumers and farmers.

                  As the service quality has been reconsidered in the public sector as well as private enterprises, the need for public sectors to adopt principle and practices of private sectors is concerned with customer-focused approach. However, the different business culture of public service organizations makes it difficult to improve service quality. It is required to establish a structured framework that leads employees to make efforts to improve their service delivery processes and supports continuous improvement of service delivery processes based on the data about the process performance from the customer-perceived value-oriented viewpoint.
                  In this paper, we propose a structured framework that identifies the key service processes, validates from customer perspectives and establishes the measurements to monitor based on the data about the process performance. It uses periodic customer satisfaction index (CSI) surveys (S.C. Park) for understanding customer-perceived values. The proposed framework consists of three phases; the questionnaire design, the key process (KP) identification from the integrated viewpoints of importance and contribution, and the key process indicator (KPI) derivation and management. For the application, we established a web-based decision support system for a public service organization for tourism in Korea.

                  Many perceive the implementation of environmental regulatory policy, especially concerning non-point source pollution from irrigated agriculture, as being less efficient in the United States than in many other countries. This is partly a result of the stakeholder involvement process but is also a reflection of the inability to make effective use of Environmental Decision Support Systems (EDSS) to facilitate technical information exchange with stakeholders and to provide a forum for innovative ideas for controlling non-point source pollutant loading. This paper describes one of the success stories where a standardized Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methodology was modified to better suit regulation of a trace element in agricultural subsurface drainage and information technology was developed to help guide stakeholders, provide assurances to the public and encourage innovation while improving compliance with State water quality objectives. The geographic focus of the paper is the western San Joaquin Valley where, in 1985, evapo-concentration of selenium in agricultural subsurface drainage water, diverted into large ponds within a federal wildlife refuge, caused teratogenecity in waterfowl embryos and in other sensitive wildlife species. The fallout from this environmental disaster was a concerted attempt by State and Federal water agencies to regulate non-point source loads of the trace element selenium. The complexity of selenium hydrogeochemistry, the difficulty and expense of selenium concentration monitoring and political discord between agricultural and environmental interests created challenges to the regulation process. Innovative policy and institutional constructs, supported by environmental monitoring and the web-based data management and dissemination systems, provided essential decision support, created opportunities for adaptive management and ultimately contributed to project success. The paper provides a retrospective on the contentious planning process and offers suggestions as to how the technical and institutional issues could have been resolved faster through early adoption of some of the core principles of sound EDSS design.

There are six main objectives/benefits identified in the international literature: Safety (reduction of (potential) crashes), mobility (reduction of delays and travel times), efficiency (optimise the use of existing infrastructure), productivity (cost saving), energy/environment and customer satisfaction [Mitretek Systems, 2001. Intelligent Transport System Benefits: 2001 update, Under Contract to the Federal Highway Administration, US Department of Transportation, Washington, DC, US]. In the South African context, there is an interest for measures that can reduce (potential) crashes. In South Africa the number of year on year traffic related fatalities is still increasing. In 2005 the number of fatalities was 15393 (from 14135 in 2004) while the estimated costs for the same period increased from R8.89-billion to R9.99-billion [RTMC, 2007. Interim Road Traffic and Fatal Crash Report 2006, Road Traffic Management Corporation, Pretoria, SA]. Given the extent of the road safety problem and the potential benefits of ITS, the need for further research is apparent. A study with regards to the potential of different types of models (macroscopic, mesoscopic and miscroscopic simulation models) led to the use of Paramics. Two corridors and three types of ITS measures were investigated and safety benefits were estimated.

                  The 21st century continues to witness the transformation of organizational systems globally through the deployment of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The health care sector is no exception to the inter-organizational dynamics driven by ICT innovations, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, nomadic information systems and nano-technology. This study explores inter-sectorial informational network dynamics by extending Zhu's Wu-Shi-Ren (WSR)-Li framework into the Realpolitik of e-health systems transnationally. This key informant study of the perceptions of inter-sectorial executives engaged in evolving symbiotic dyadic e-health networks in Canada, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom appears to support Zhu's WSR-Li model. A key finding of this study is that relational and transactional capital and transformational competencies are essential to the evolution of such e-networks, but they are not sufficient. These components must transcend the boundaries of the dyadic e-networks to engage and integrate transcendent forces in the form of public governance agents rooted in larger socio-political environments. In effect, information system professionals must acquire transcendent knowledge and skill sets to engage the “transgenic” forces, or key socio-political elements, that are critical in evolving inter-sectorial e-networks. Engaging and co-opting these transgenic forces appears to be particularly important in national health care systems, where public governance is a key socio-political value. This underscores the need for further research to explore how transgenic forces influence the evolution of a range of ICT systems inter-sectorially in different socio-political environments.

                  Objective
                  Pituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist before IVF may result in a plateau or decrease in estradiol levels. We sought to investigate the effect of increasing recombinant FSH (rFSH) after starting a GnRH antagonist on estradiol levels, implantation rates, and pregnancy rates.
               
                  Design
                  Prospective, randomized multicenter study.
               
                  Setting
                  Military medical center and private practice.
               
                  Patient(s)
                  Sixty infertile women undergoing IVF who met the appropriate inclusion criteria.
               
                  Intervention(s)
                  Participants were pretreated with combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and received a dose 150–300 IU of rFSH 5 days after taking their last COC. They were randomly assigned to receive their current dose of rFSH (control group) or an additional 75 IU of rFSH (step-up group) after starting a GnRH antagonist. Daily GnRH antagonist injections were started when the lead follicles were 13–14 mm in diameter and continued until hCG was given when two follicles were ≥18 mm. One to three embryos were transferred 3 or 5 days following oocyte retrieval. Women with PCOS, a body mass index >33, a day 3 FSH >14.1 mIU/mL, or prior poor stimulation were excluded.
               
                  Main Outcome Measure(s)
                  The primary endpoints of this pilot study were embryo implantation, pregnancy, and livebirth rates. Secondary endpoints included the amount and days of rFSH; number of days of GnRH antagonist use; estradiol levels on the day of GnRH antagonist initiation, day 1 and day 2 after initiation, and on the day of hCG; endometrial stripe thickness; number of follicles; and number of oocytes.
               
                  Result(s)
                  No differences were reported within the groups with respect to age, BMI, baseline FSH, use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, vials of rFSH, number of GnRH antagonist injections, changes in estradiol patterns, or peak estradiol level. The control and step-up groups had similar pregnancies (73.3% vs. 63.3%, P=.41), clinical pregnancies (70.0% vs. 60.0%, P=.42), live births (56.7% vs. 60.0%, P=.8), and implantation rates (50.0% and 39.1%, P=.22).
               
                  Conclusion(s)
                  The use of rFSH and a GnRH antagonist in good candidates for IVF resulted in outstanding implantation and pregnancy rates. Increasing the dose of rFSH after starting a GnRH antagonist does not alter the estradiol response or improve the implantation and pregnancy rates.

                  In 2002, Medicare health insurance recognized the relationship between pedestrian environments and public health by providing co-pay for health care delivered in residential land use. In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits.
                  A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area.
                  A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes. This collaboration was our first phase in developing intelligent tools for designers that provided site-specific user-specific data to the planner or designer of pedestrian space.

                  Fifteen 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy’) users who did not have other drug dependencies or prolonged alcohol abuse and 15 control subjects were studied. All the subjects were exposed to the same psychosocial stressor (Stroop Color–Word Interference Task, public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of an audience) 3 weeks after MDMA discontinuation. Plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were measured immediately before the tests began and at their end, 30 min later. Growth hormone (GH) responses to the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine and psychometric measures (Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Buss–Durkee Hostility Inventory) were also obtained 4 weeks after MDMA discontinuation for the same subjects. ACTH and cortisol basal levels were significantly higher in ecstasy users than in control subjects. In contrast, ACTH and cortisol responses to stress were significantly blunted in MDMA users. The sensitivity of dopamine D2 receptors, reflected by GH responses to bromocriptine challenge, was reduced in MDMA users compared with controls. The responsiveness of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis (ACTH and cortisol delta peaks) correlated directly with GH areas under curves in response to bromocriptine, and inversely with psychometric measures of aggressiveness and novelty seeking. No correlation was found between hormonal measures and the extent of MDMA exposure. Reduced D2 receptor sensitivity, HPA basal hyperactivation and reduced responsiveness to stress may represent a complex neuroendocrine dysfunction associated with MDMA use. The present findings do not exclude the possibility that dopamine dysfunction partly predated MDMA exposure.

                     TROPIX is a practical application project initially designed to help improve health care delivery in the rural/semi urban clinics and public hospitals in Nigeria due largely to limited laboratory facilities, medical doctors, and expertise. This paper is devoted to the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) paradigm in concert with statistical association-based reasoning (ABR) for disease diagnosis, validation and therapy selection components of the research. Essentially, tentative disease diagnosis arrived at by some classification method using similarity and dissimilarity aggregate functions, the matched vector functions (MVF), aided by the application of evidence ratio factors (ERF) for tied match cases is passed to the CBR model for validation by reusing past similar cases. The design and organization of the case-library using singular value decomposition (SVD) technique on the disease-attribute decision matrix to generate primary/secondary storage key clusters, as well as the use of domain-specific case-object properties that help to build a good case-base are described in some detail. The paper presents a disease case validation algorithm for appropriate data filtering and therapy selection enhancement from the new case-base.

                     OBJECTIVES: We determined the prevalence of prenatal cocaine use in a racially mixed sample of urban and suburban mothers and correlated its use with maternal demographics and newborn measurements.
                  
                     STUDY DESIGN: Meconium from 621 consecutive newborns delivered at two university-affiliated urban hospitals were assayed for benzoylecgonine. Maternal and infant characteristics were linked anonymously with the results. Statistical analysis included t tests, Fisher's exact test, Duncan's multiple range analysis, and analysis of covariance, with a value of p < 0.05 considered significant.
                  
                     RESULTS: We found that 3.4% of meconium samples had benzoylecgonine levels exceeding 0.1 µg/ml. Its presence was statistically correlated with maternal and neonatal characteristics. A nurse's opinion of cocaine use was correct 22% of the time.
                  
                     CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal cocaine use was statistically associated with multiparity, multigravidity, late-onset and clinic-based prenatal care, public assistance, nonwhite race, and low academic achievement. A nurse's opinion was a poor predictor of maternal cocaine use. Cocaine-exposed infants were significantly smaller, and this correlated best with nonwhite background.

                  The objective of this study was to predict concentrations of a toxicant in plasma after exposure to the toxicant through drinking water using basic pharmacokinetic principles. As an example, we studied pentachlorophenol (PCP), a widely used wood preservative of public health concern as an environmental pollutant. We added PCP to the drinking water (30 μg/mL) of five rats for 3 days. Blood was sampled, and water consumption was monitored every 12h on the days 1 and 2 and every 3h on day 3. After a 4-day washout, a PCP dose of 2.5 mg/kg was given intravenously, and blood was withdrawn at selected times for 2 days. PCP concentrations in plasma were measured by capillary gas chromatography. A one-compartment model with zero-order input and kinetic parameters (clearance, volume of distribution, and bioavailability) estimated after intravenous administration adequately predicted PCP concentrations in plasma during exposure to PCP. The average steady-state concentration (C
                     ss), which reflects the overall exposure, was predicted using the clearance (CL) concept [i.e., C
                     ss = (bioavailability • rate of intake)/CL] and compared with the observed value. The data for PCP demonstrate the potential utility of CL and other kinetic concepts in assessing exposure to a toxicant in drinking water, food, or air.

                  Mental health planning is partly a political process, involving the articulation of the long-range interests of a regional community, formation of consensus among key people and the appropriate investment of authority, power and responsibility. Conflicts between the short-term self-interests of planners and the longer-term general interest usually arise. This paper claims that it is feasible to increase the expected number of cases in which a region's longer-term interest is served without radical changes in existing planning processes or ideologies.
                  The means for doing this are new kinds of information systems that serve planners as tools to increase their awareness about assumptions, hypotheses and problem representations. The conceptual and technological bases for developing such systems stem from progress in artificial intelligence in the direction of hypothesis-processing algorithms. The proposed application to mental health planning is described. Arguments are presented to show how the use of such tools would increase the likelihood that longer-term regional interests are served.

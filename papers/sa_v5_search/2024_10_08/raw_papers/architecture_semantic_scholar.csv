Adding constraints such as no-fly zones, time limitations, permission prerequisites etc. to mission orders allows operators to legally and ethically control mobile systems that have the potential for deliberate (or unintentional) lethal force. Ethical control can be practically achieved by providing parsable (and ethically validatable) orders to diverse unmanned systems. Ethical Control of Unmanned Systems The authors have been engaged for several decades in academic research and military service relating to mission specification and execution for submarines, aircraft, and ground vehicles, both manned and robotic. We have increasingly focused on maritime robotics, especially with regard to execution of unmanned underwater vehicle missions under varying degrees of human oversight and ethical constraints. This work has included numerous simulations and also deployed experiments (Brutzman et al. 1998; Brutzman, McGhee, and Davis 2012; Brutzman, Davis, Blais, and McGhee 2016). Common conclusions that treat ethical robots as an always-amoral philosophical conundrum or requiring undemonstrated morality-based artificial intelligence (AI) are simply not sensible or repeatable. For better or worse, actors around the world are rapidly designing and deploying mobile unmanned systems to augment human capabilities. Thus theory must meet practice. This contribution describes how mission orders can be specified in forms readable by both human operators and robot systems, including both syntactic validation of correctness and semantic validation of logical coherence. This approach has the potential to meet the moral requirements of international laws regarding human responsibility during armed conflict when unmanned systems are deployed.

The path to reach our present point of view has come from understanding that the Rational Behavior Model (RBM) software architecture used in our work has broader applicability than previously realized. This is because RBM depends upon a software construct called a Mission Execution Automaton (MEA) that is an extension of a Turing machine (TM) allowing the incorporation of arbitrary external agents. Such agents are presumed to be capable of interaction with their environment and returning one of a predetermined set of values to the finite state machine (FSM) portion of the MEA. Ternary logic is helpful, where allowable values returned from a query/command to an external agent have been limited to the set [success, failure, constraint]. Applied to a multiphase mission, concise mission-branch definition simplifies execution logic needed by remote systems. When a value constraint is returned, it can be taken to mean either that the current environment makes it unethical to complete the current phase, that a phase timeout has occurred, or that success or failure of the current phase cannot be determined, etc. Exception-handling steps can then occur. Recent work has reached the next level, defining a Mission Execution Ontology (MEO) implemented in RDF/OWL that relates mission goals, task prerequisites and operating constraints with vehicle capabilities. MEO validation can be performed as part of tasking robotic or human external agents. This means that humanunderstandable orders to unmanned systems can further be semantically validated for logical correctness, ensuring that tasking of remote systems meets the same level of ethical rigor expected in human-to human orders. Confirmed validation makes authority meaningful for responsible humans. In three-level robot architectures such as RBM, existing vehicle commands/missions can be incorporated as behaviors subject to overall regulation by rational (finite state) supervision of a mission-definition graph. Such tasking can be understood by qualified humans who are not computer professionals, much in the same way that military mission orders written in structured human language are understandable. Well-specified definitions of mission tasks and constraints can also be performed by a wide variety of diverse robot control code. With such a common understanding, it is possible to assign legal and moral responsibility for correct and ethical mission definition to a single (legally culpable) human individual. We believe that this kind of strong accountability is essential to military accountability, and may eventually become relevant for emerging robotic technologies affecting public safety. Algorithms cannot replace human responsibility. Even so, a fully testable technology (such as that provided by the MEA and MEO formalisms) allows for the assignment of human accountability. Specifically, the MEA provides a mathematically rigorous mechanism for mission definition and execution as an exhaustively testable flow diagram. This approach ensures that accountable operators can fully understand all high-level task sequences before authorizing robot operations. The MEO employs description logics (DLs) and Semantic Web technologies to provide strong assurances that MEA mission definitions are semantically correct and fully executable by specific target vehicles. By applying the best strengths of human ethical responsibility, repeatable formal logic and directable unmanned systems together, these capabilities provide a practical framework for ethically grounded human supervision of unmanned systems.",AAAI Fall Symposia,2017,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',

Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called ”algorithmic bias” of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.",Digital Government Research,2019,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1145/3325112.3325242

This revamped version of policy analysis continues the long-standing tradition of applying statistical modeling to better understand policy effects and decision making, but also incorporates other computational approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and computer simulation. Although much attention has been given to the development of capabilities for data analysis, there is much less attention to understanding the role of data management in a context of AI in government. In this paper, we argue that data management capabilities are foundational to data analysis of any kind, but even more important in the present AI context. This is so because without proper data management, simply acquiring data or systems will not produce desired outcomes. We also argue that realizing the potential of AI for social good relies on investments specifically focused on this social outcome, investments in the processes of building trust in government data, and ensuring the data are ready and suitable for use, for both immediate and future uses.",Digital Government Research,2019,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1145/3325112.3325245

The start-up called Babcock & Bonbright was built as part of the Central Europe AI portfolio – a start-up studio focused on using artificial intelligence to innovate in the financial and healthcare sectors. The presentation will focus mainly on the technological aspect of the project – linking structured data, NLP, and image processing to a comprehensive system for estimating the value of dwellings and apartments using machine learning. Attention will also be paid to the processing of map data, system architecture and data pipeline design. Our pricing models leverage several types of machine learning models in a hierarchical manner. For the pricing estimation, we use socalled “comparables” – recently sold houses that are close and somewhat similar (comparable) to the subject property. The main pricing model is used to compute the adjusted price for each comparable in the neighborhood using gradient boosted decision trees. The comparables are selected by location, feature similarity and image similarity. The pricing model uses features from both the subject property and comparable property, as well as combined features such as distance, image similarity, ratios of selected original features, common categorical features, common points of interest in the area, etc. The final price estimation for the subject property is determined by averaging price adjustments across all of the comparables. Bulk of the features are created from structured and semi-structured data about the property – public sale records, offers listings, map and traffic data, school districts, and crime.

More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. ""Kisan One"" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India.

The self-adversarial agent is implemented using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The agent attempts to self-attack the system based on two GAN variants, vanilla GAN and conditional GAN. By turning the attacking quality through generating realistic secret keys used in the PPUF primitive into system vulnerability, the security architecture is able to monitor its internal vulnerability. If the vulnerability level reaches at a specific value, PUFGAN allows the system to restructure its underlying security primitive via feedback to the PPUF hardware, maintaining security entropy at as high a level as possible.We evaluated PUFGAN on three different machine environments: Google Colab, a desktop PC, and a Raspberry Pi 2, using a real-world PPUF dataset.

It is not just a question of machines making mistakes; it is the embedding of values, biases and prejudices in software which can discriminate against both individuals and groups in society. Such biases are often hard either to detect or prove, particularly where there are problems with transparency and accountability and where such systems are outsourced to the private sector. Consequently, being able to detect and categorise these risks is essential in order to develop a systematic and calibrated response.

Generative Modeling, such as various Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) models, has been applied to generate paintings and music. Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) also had a leap forward in 2018 since the release of the pre-trained contextual neural language models such as BERT and recently released GPT3. Despite the exciting AI applications aforementioned, AI is still significantly lagging behind humans in creativity, which is often considered the ultimate moonshot for AI. Our work is inspired by Chinese calligraphy, which is a unique form of visual art where the character itself is an aesthetic painting. We also draw inspirations from paintings of the Abstract Expressionist movement in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the work by American painter Franz Kline. In this paper, we present a creative framework based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Contextual Neural Language Model to generate abstract artworks that have intrinsic meaning and aesthetic value, which is different from the existing work, such as image captioning and text-to-image generation, where the texts are the descriptions of the images. In addition, we have publicly released a Chinese calligraphy image dataset and demonstrate our framework using a prototype system and a user study.",arXiv.org,2020,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',

A barrier is the need to generate and constantly post novel but on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck. Objective In this study, we aim to harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a pilot system that can generate many candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign to suggest novel, on-topic candidate messages. The issue of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example; however, the system can work with other issues that could benefit from higher levels of public awareness. Methods We used the Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine-tuned it using a data set of autodownloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine-tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is, to create new messages about this topic. We conducted a web-based study to gauge how human raters evaluate AI-generated tweet messages compared with original, human-crafted messages. Results We found that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Web-based raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a human-curated sample of AI-generated messages as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results showed that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for web-based campaigns that focus on promoting awareness. Conclusions The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for the quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2021,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.2196/28858

Despite the proliferation of these ""AI principles"", there is mounting public concern over the influence that the AI systems have in our society, and coalitions in all sectors are organizing to resist harmful applications of AI worldwide. Responses from peoples everywhere, from workers protesting unethical conduct and applications of AI, to student's protesting MIT's relationships with donor, sex trafficker, and pedophile Jeffery Epstein, to the healthcare community, to indigenous people addressing “the twin problems of a lack of reliable data and information on indigenous peoples and biopiracy and misuse of their traditional knowledge and cultural heritage”, to smart city stakeholders, to many others. Like corporations, governments around the world have adopted strategies for becoming leaders in the development and use of Artificial Intelligence, fostering environments congenial to AI innovators. Neither corporations nor policymakers have sufficiently addressed how the rights of children fit into their AI strategies or products. The role of artificial intelligence in children’s lives—from how children play, to how they are educated, to how they consume information and learn about the world—is expected to increase exponentially over the coming years. Thus, it’s imperative that stakeholders evaluate the risks and assess opportunities to use artificial intelligence to maximize children’s wellbeing in a thoughtful and systematic manner. This paper discusses AI and children's rights in the context of social media platforms such as YouTube, smart toys, and AI education applications. The Hello Barbie, Cloud Pets, and Cayla smart toys case studies are analyzed, as well as the ElsaGate social media hacks and education's new Intelligent Tutoring Systems and surveillance of students apps. Though AI has valuable benefits for children, it presents some particular challenges around important issues including child safety, privacy, data privacy, device security and consent. Technology giants, all of whom are heavily investing in and profiting from AI, must not dominate the public discourse on responsible use of AI. We all need to shape the future of our core values and democratic institutions. As artificial intelligence continues to find its way into our daily lives, its propensity to interfere with our rights only gets more severe. Many of the issues mentioned in this examination of harmful AI are not new, but they are greatly exacerbated and threatened by the scale, proliferation, and real-life impact that artificial intelligence facilitates. The potential of artificial intelligence to both help and harm people is much greater than earlier technologies. Continuing to examine what safeguards and structures can address AI’s problems and harms, including those that disproportionately impact marginalized people, is a critical activity. There are assumptions embedded in the AI algorithms that will shape how our world is realized. Many of these algorithms are wrongful and biased, they must get locked-in. Our best human judgment is needed to contain AI's harmful impacts. Perhaps one of the greatest contributions of AI will be to make us ultimately understand how important human wisdom truly is in life on earth.",Social Science Research Network,2021,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.2139/ssrn.3880779

Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this purpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and Recurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent Variable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three experimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI methodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply chain. In particular, these concern: (i) predicting plant growth and tomato yield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and reducing food waste or food unavailability; (ii) optimizing energy consumption across large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal selection of systems that can be shut-down and through prediction of the respective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load; (iii) optical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in automatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and people’s health.",Electronics,2021,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.3390/ELECTRONICS10111223

Molecular design is particularly important owing to its broad application domains and boundless creativity attributed to progresses in generative models. The recent maturity of molecular generative models has stimulated expectations for practical use among potential users, who are not necessarily familiar with coding or scripting, such as experimental engineers and students in chemical domains. However, most of the existing molecular generative models are Python libraries on GitHub, that are accessible for only IT-savvy users. To fill this gap, we newly developed a graphical user interface (GUI)-based web application of molecular generative models, Molecule Generation Experience, that is open to the general public. This is the first web application of molecular generative models enabling users to work with built-in datasets to carry out molecular design. In this paper, we describe the background technology extended from our previous work. Our new online evaluation and structural filtering algorithms significantly improved the generation speed by 30 to 1,000 times with a wider structural variety, satisfying chemical stability and synthetic reality. We also describe in detail our Kubernetes-based scalable cloud architecture and user-oriented GUI that are necessary components to achieve a public service.

This discussion, however, has primarily focused on those systems developed for social functions, e.g., social robots. Given the increasing interdependence of society with nonsocial machines, examining how existing normative claims could be extended to specific disrupted sectors, such as the art industry, has become imperative. Inspired by the proposals to ground machines’ moral status on social relations advanced by Gunkel and Coeckelbergh, this research presents online experiments (∑N = 448) that test whether and how interacting with AI-generated art affects the perceived moral standing of its creator, i.e., the AI-generative system. Our results indicate that assessing an AI system’s lack of mind could influence how people subsequently evaluate AI-generated art. We also find that the overvaluation of AI-generated images could negatively affect their creator’s perceived agency. Our experiments, however, did not suggest that interacting with AI-generated art has any significant effect on the perceived moral standing of the machine. These findings reveal that social-relational approaches to AI rights could be intertwined with property-based theses of moral standing.

Given the advanced capabilities of new AI systems, it is critical that these are embedded using standard operational procedures, clear epistemic criteria, and behave in alignment with the normative expectations of society. Scholars in multiple domains have subsequently begun to conceptualize the different forms that AI applications may take, highlighting both their potential benefits and pitfalls. However, the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science disciplines like public administration and political science, and the fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI. We then build on the results of this bibliometric analysis to propose three new multifaceted concepts for understanding and analysing AI-based systems for government (AI-GOV) in a more unified way: (1) operational fitness, (2) epistemic alignment, and (3) normative divergence. Finally, we put these concepts to work by using them as dimensions in a conceptual typology of AI-GOV and connecting each with emerging AI technical measurement standards to encourage operationalization, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and stimulate debate among those aiming to rethink government with AI.",Journal of Grid Computing,2022,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.48550/arXiv.2210.17218

Data analysis and AI technology are deployed to enhance the intelligent and accurate use of Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras for crime prevention, security, and public safety purposes. The use of facial recognition technology enables an individual to be identified by processing images captured on CCTV, the suspects to be tracked on the CCTV footage, and crime scenes to be monitored in real time. Amidst this expansion, there is an increasing need for discussions to protect privacy. The need for privacy control is emphasized as data collection, retention, and utilization capabilities resulting in losing control over individual’s own information. The value and importance of personal data have been changed from the previous, and government surveillance issues arises as vast quantities of personal data being stored and easily shared. The need for government data access for various purposes and storage of data on a large scale may lead to the privacy right and the infringement of informational self-determination. In a situation where the use of CCTV information is allowed and gradually expanding, it is difficult to evaluate that legal grounds for controlling the actions of government agencies or guaranteeing the rights of individual subjects are sufficient.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are popular for synthesis and data augmentation. GANs have been explored for data augmentation to enhance the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 within lung computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images. However, the role of GANs in overcoming data scarcity for COVID-19 is not well understood. Objective This review presents a comprehensive study on the role of GANs in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data scarcity and diagnosis. It is the first review that summarizes different GAN methods and lung imaging data sets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code. Methods A search was conducted on 5 databases, namely PubMed, IEEEXplore, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from October 11-13, 2021. The search was conducted using intervention keywords, such as “generative adversarial networks” and “GANs,” and application keywords, such as “COVID-19” and “coronavirus.” The review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for systematic and scoping reviews. Only those studies were included that reported GAN-based methods for analyzing chest X-ray images, chest CT images, and chest ultrasound images. Any studies that used deep learning methods but did not use GANs were excluded. No restrictions were imposed on the country of publication, study design, or outcomes. Only those studies that were in English and were published from 2020 to 2022 were included. No studies before 2020 were included. Results This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lung imaging data. Most of the studies (n=42, 74%) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and superresolution of lung images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures, used in 9 studies each. In addition, 29 (51%) studies used chest X-ray images, while 21 (37%) studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For the majority of the studies (n=47, 82%), the experiments were conducted and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only 2 (4%) studies. Conclusions Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lung images in COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs’ performance through the superresolution of the images and segmentation.

PBPK model development requires collection of species-specific physiological, and chemical-specific absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) parameters, which can be a time-consuming and expensive process. This raises a need to create computational models capable of predicting input parameter values for PBPK models, especially for new compounds. In this review, we summarize an emerging paradigm for integrating PBPK modeling with machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational methods. This paradigm includes three steps: (a) obtain time-concentration PK data and/or ADME parameters from publicly available databases, (b) develop ML/AI-based approaches to predict ADME parameters, and (c) incorporate the ML/AI models into PBPK models to predict PK summary statistics (e.g., area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration). We also discuss a neural network architecture ""neural ordinary differential equation (Neural-ODE)"" that is capable of providing better predictive capabilities than other ML methods when used to directly predict time-series PK profiles. In order to support applications of ML/AI methods for PBPK model development, several challenges should be addressed: (1) as more data become available, it is important to expand the training set by including structural diversity of compounds to improve the prediction accuracy of ML/AI models; (2) due to the black box nature of many ML models, lack of sufficient interpretability is a limitation; (3) Neural-ODE has great potential to be used to generate time-series PK profiles for new compounds with limited ADME information, but its application remains to be explored.

Motivated by these drivers, this paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a reference architecture called Imtidad that provides Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a Service (DAIaaS) over cloud, fog, and edge using a service catalog case study containing 22 AI skin disease diagnosis services. These services belong to four service classes that are distinguished based on software platforms (containerized gRPC, gRPC, Android, and Android Nearby) and are executed on a range of hardware platforms (Google Cloud, HP Pavilion Laptop, NVIDIA Jetson nano, Raspberry Pi Model B, Samsung Galaxy S9, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4) and four network types (Fiber, Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth). The AI models for the diagnosis include two standard Deep Neural Networks and two Tiny AI deep models to enable their execution at the edge, trained and tested using 10,015 real-life dermatoscopic images. The services are evaluated using several benchmarks including model service value, response time, energy consumption, and network transfer time. A DL service on a local smartphone provides the best service in terms of both energy and speed, followed by a Raspberry Pi edge device and a laptop in fog.

While their recommendations converge on a set of central values, little is known about the values a more representative public would find important for the AI technologies they interact with and might be affected by. We conducted a survey examining how individuals perceive and prioritize responsible AI values across three groups: a representative sample of the US population (N=743), a sample of crowdworkers (N=755), and a sample of AI practitioners (N=175). Our results empirically confirm a common concern: AI practitioners’ value priorities differ from those of the general public. Compared to the US-representative sample, AI practitioners appear to consider responsible AI values as less important and emphasize a different set of values. In contrast, self-identified women and black respondents found responsible AI values more important than other groups. Surprisingly, more liberal-leaning participants, rather than participants reporting experiences with discrimination, were more likely to prioritize fairness than other groups.

Determining how to profit from data deluge can give companies an edge in the market because data have the potential to add tremendous value to many aspects of a business. The market has already seen a level of monetization across vertical domains in the form of layering connected devices with a variety of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) choices, such as subscription plans or smart device insights. Out of this arena is evolving a “machine economy” in which the ability to correctly monetize data rather than simply hoard it, will provide a significant advantage in a competitive digital environment. The recent advent of the technological advances in the fields of big data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues of competition, where data are utilized strategically and treated as a continuously changing asset able to unleash new revenue opportunities for monetization. Such growth has made room for an onslaught of new tools, architectures, business models, platforms, and marketplaces that enable organizations to successfully monetize data. In fact, emerging business models are striving to alter the power balance between users and companies that harvest information. Start-ups and organizations are offering to sell user data to data analytics companies and other businesses. Monetizing data goes beyond just selling data. It is also possible to include steps that add value to data. Generally, organizations can monetize data by: 1) utilizing it to make better business decisions or improve processes; 2) surrounding flagship services or products with data; or 3) selling information to current or new markets. This article will address all important aspects of IoT data monetization with more focus on the healthcare industry and discuss the corresponding challenges, such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, security, and privacy.

Since the last decades, AI systems are increasingly deployed by governments across the planet to manage public infrastructures and resources, as well as to engage with citizens for the provision of public services. Their introduction is advertised as a cost-cutting tool, as well as an instrument to combat traditional institutional disfunctions such as inefficiency, understaffing, corruption and human bias. While AI offers an incredible potential for progress, an emerging body of literature highlights the challenges that AI-driven decision-making may raise for a public sector ethics. A common trait of these challenges is their being related to some form of ""epistemological opacity"" that undermines the capacity of humans to explain and justify decisions based on AI systems, detect errors or unfairness and adopt corrective actions. The situation may entail public officers and citizens taking the outcomes of AI systems at face value, thus basing their actions (wholly or in part) on pieces of information that cannot be scrutinized and/or corrected if necessary. This paper intends to contribute to an emerging but still underdeveloped trend in normative political theory that study how AI-driven decision-making is reshaping the conceptualization and assessment of interactions between citizens and public officials. The overall goal of the paper is to analyze how various sources of ""epistemological opacity"" (algorithmic/legal/illiteracy/discursive) affecting AI systems, may undermine the democratic legitimacy of public decisions based on them. Broadly speaking, legitimacy is the property that grounds the exercise of political authority, where authority standardly means the right to rule [1]. In this paper, democratic legitimacy is understood as a distinctive form of political authority grounded in the recognition of citizens as joint legislators. The paper offers a conception of democratic legitimacy conditional on the capacity of decision-making procedures and outcomes to realize the principle of public equality, which requires citizens' control over public decision-making, as well as respect for their equal status as political decision-makers. Specifically, the paper argues that the ""epistemological opacity"" affecting AI-driven decision-making systems, brings about a mistreatment of citizens as coauthors of public decisions, which is a premise of the idea of democratic citizenship. The main conjecture is that different sources of ""epistemological opacity"" (algorithmic/legal/illiteracy/discursive) are causing the disengagement of citizens and public officers from public decision-making, either because they directly undermine necessary conditions for the realization of public equality (co-authorship/accountability/publicity), or because they hide from the public eye instances of illegitimate automation and privatization of decisional power. The paper offers a normative conception of democratic legitimacy that may contribute to efforts in various fields, including ""AI fairness"" and ""Explainable AI"", to better adapt technological tools to equality requirements distinctive of public decision-making within democratic societies.","AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",2022,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1145/3514094.3539563

Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support.

While ChatGPT has been shown to provide answers of sufficient quality to pass some university exams, its capacity to write essays that require an exploration of value concepts is unknown. This paper presents the results of a study where ChatGPT-4 (released May 2023) was tasked with writing a 1500-word essay to discuss the nature of values used in the assessment of cultural heritage significance. Based on an analysis of 36 iterations, ChatGPT wrote essays of limited length with about 50% of the stipulated word count being primarily descriptive and without any depth or complexity. The concepts, which are often flawed and suffer from inverted logic, are presented in an arbitrary sequence with limited coherence and without any defined line of argument. Given that it is a generative language model, ChatGPT often splits concepts and uses one or more words to develop tangential arguments. While ChatGPT provides references as tasked, many are fictitious, albeit with plausible authors and titles. At present, ChatGPT has the ability to critique its own work but seems unable to incorporate that critique in a meaningful way to improve a previous draft.

The study aims to investigate how these advanced AI technologies, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can address the sector's pressing challenges, such as load forecasting, power outage prediction, and preventive maintenance.
Methodology- The study employs a qualitative case study methodology, providing an in-depth analysis of real-world applications of generative AI within electricity distribution companies. The selection of cases represents a wide variety of experiences and contexts, facilitated by both primary data collected through semi-structured interviews with key personnel within the organizations and secondary data derived from an extensive review of company reports, public documentation, and industry publications. The gathered data was systematically analyzed using thematic analysis to identify and report recurring patterns and themes.
Findings- The analysis reveals that generative AI has been successfully implemented in various operational aspects of electricity distribution. The first case study presents how GANs have significantly improved load forecasting accuracy in an Eastern Turkish electricity distribution company. The second case study from Southern Turkey showcases how GANs have been used for predicting power outages, thereby aiding efficient resource allocation, reducing downtime, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Lastly, the third case from Northern Turkey demonstrates how generative AI has contributed to effective preventive maintenance of distribution equipment, improving overall system reliability.
Conclusion- Based on the analysis findings, it may be concluded that generative AI holds transformative potential for the electricity distribution sector. While the implementation of these technologies is associated with challenges such as data privacy, security, and the requirement of technical expertise, the benefits in terms of improved accuracy, system reliability, and resource efficiency provide a strong justification for their adoption. The paper underlines the importance of an interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, electrical engineers, industry professionals, and policymakers for furthering the adoption of these technologies. As the field of generative AI continues to evolve, it is expected to have an even greater impact on the electricity distribution sector, thereby opening up exciting opportunities for future research and application.

They often have valuable data that could be used for training, but their computing resources are limited, while data privacy concerns prevent them from sharing this data for public training. A possible solution to overcome these two issues is to utilise the crowd-souring principles and apply federated learning techniques to build a distributed privacy-preserving architecture for training Generative AI.

By ‘AI’, we refer to the use of machine learning, algorithms, large datasets, neural networks and traditional statistical reasoning by computing. The term ‘AI’ is misleading: Despite suggestions to the contrary (Bubeck et al., 2023) – and some surely impressive achievements in specific areas –we are still far from reaching the benchmark of ‘general human intelligence’. AI has undergone several generations, from ‘good old-fashioned AI’ (Haugeland, 1989), the defined algorithms of which failed at the common sense problem, to the current and more successful generation of neural network and deep learning AI. One specific form of current AI is ‘generative AI’ (e.g. ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney) – and without a doubt, it’s the ‘technology hype’ of 2023 and the focus of this editorial comment. Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, became a ‘cultural sensation’ (Thorp, 2023) rather rapidly in early 2023. When Daniel brought up generative AI as a future ethical issue at a panel for journal editors on publishing ethics in December 2022 (Burton-Jones et al., 2022), many audience members seemed unfamiliar withMidjourney orChatGPT.However, within just a few weeks, the landscape shifted dramatically. Publicly launched on 30 November 2022, ChatGPT – a chatbot built on top of a text-generating AI – had an impressive debut, reaching onemillion users within 5 days and surpassing 100million users in January 2023 (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Since then, ChatGPT has become widely used and is believed to impact many areas, including research and science (Hill-Yardin et al., 2023; Liebrenz et al., 2023; Lund and Wang, 2023). While detailed explanations of the underlying technology can be found in other sources (Goodfellow et al., 2016), generative AI is a subset of deep learning AI that specialises in producing human-like outputs. OpenAI’s ChatGPToperates on a neural network AI architecture, GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). Although ChatGPT might have seemed like a natural progression of the AI domain, especially since Midjourney and DALL-E had been introduced earlier, it astonished global audiences and led companies like Alphabet (Google) to hastily release comparable tools (Teubner et al., 2023). Simplified, deep learning AI systems ‘hallucinate’ ‘plausible looking’ (though not necessarily accurate) responses to user prompts. They base these responses on patterns of ‘likeness’ (associations between words and concepts), stored in a digital neural network (multiple layers of interconnected nodes) and learnt from massive training datasets. Such systems can quickly generate high-quality images and texts, outperforming traditional algorithms. However, this advanced capability is accompanied by the challenge of the ‘black box’ problem:wemay understand the model’s general principles, but the reasons behind specific decisions remain opaque. The neural network provides a flexible, changing structure, inspired by the human brain, that encodes patterns, but not in an intelligible, auditable manner – there is no clear formula to scrutinise. (This is akin to how the reader might instantly and reliably distinguish between their mother and their cat but would be unable to write down a precise formula for this recognition process). As journal editors, the emergence of ChatGPT prompted us – and others (e.g. Hill-Yardin et al., 2023; Liebrenz et al., 2023; Lund and Wang, 2023; Teubner et al., 2023; Van Dis et al., 2023) – to ask foundational questions about using generative AI in research and science. Specifically: Is it ‘ethical’ to use generative or other AIs in conducting research or for writing academic research papers? In this editorial, we go back to first principles to reflect on the fundamental ethics to apply to using ChatGPT and AI in research and science. Next, we caution that (generative) AI is also at the ‘peak of inflated (hype) expectations’ and discuss eight in-principle issues that AI struggles with, both ethically and practically. We conclude with what this all means for the ethics of using generative AI in research and science.",Journal of Information and Technology,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1177/02683962231200411

Yet we know little about its potential role in local governance, especially the advances that AI-supported services for the public sector in local governance have ventured and the public value they have created. Combining the digital transformation concepts and public value theory, we fill the gap by examining artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in the public sector of a pilot city of digital transformation in China. Using a mixed-method approach, we show how AI configurations facilitate public value creation in the digital era and identify four dimensions of AI deployment in the public sector: data integration, policy innovation, smart application, and collaboration. Our case analysis on these four dimensions demonstrates two roles that AI technology plays in local governance—“AI cage” and “AI colleague.” The former builds the technology infrastructure and platform in each stage of service delivery, regulating the behaviors of frontline workers, while the latter helps frontline workers make decisions, thus improving the agility of public service provision.",Public Policy and Administration,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1177/09520767231188229

The pioneering use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various fields and sectors, and the growing ethical debate about its application have led research centers, public and private institutions to establish ethical guidelines for a trustworthy implementation of these powerful algorithms. Despite the recognized definition of ethical principles for a responsible or trustworthy use of AI, there is a lack of a sector-specific perspective that highlights the ethical risks and opportunities for different areas of application, especially in the field of Cultural Heritage (CH). In fact, there is still a lack of formal frameworks that evaluate the algorithms’ adherence to the ethical standards set by the European Union for the use of AI in protecting CH and its inherent value. Because of this, it is necessary to investigate a different sectoral viewpoint to supplement the widely used horizontal approach. This paper represents a first attempt to design an ethical framework to embody AI in CH conservation practises to assess various risks arising from the use of AI in the field of CH. The contribution presents a synthesis of the different AI applications to improve the preservation process of CH. It explores and analyses in depth the ethical challenges and opportunities presented by the use of AI to improve CH preservation. In addition, the study aims to design an ethical framework of principles to assess the application of this ground-breaking technology at CH.

The analysis shows that AI has the power to play a crucial role in the life-cycle of rules, by performing time-consuming tasks, increasing access to knowledge base, and enhancing the ability of institutions to draft effective rules and to declutter the regulatory stock. However, it is not without risks, ranging from discrimination to challenges to democratic representation. In order to play a role in achieving law effectiveness while limiting the risks, a complementarity between human and AI should be reached both at the level of the AI architecture and ex post.

It plays a significant role in driving the economy, public safety, and managing health care costs. Digital tools, including websites, sleep trackers, and apps, are key in promoting sleep health education. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, Microsoft Corp) offers accessible, personalized advice on sleep health but raises concerns about potential misinformation. This underscores the importance of ensuring that AI-driven sleep health information is accurate, given its significant impact on individual and public health, and the spread of sleep-related myths. Objective This study aims to examine ChatGPT’s capability to debunk sleep-related disbeliefs. Methods A mixed methods design was leveraged. ChatGPT categorized 20 sleep-related myths identified by 10 sleep experts and rated them in terms of falseness and public health significance, on a 5-point Likert scale. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and interrater agreement were also calculated. A qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted. Results ChatGPT labeled a significant portion (n=17, 85%) of the statements as “false” (n=9, 45%) or “generally false” (n=8, 40%), with varying accuracy across different domains. For instance, it correctly identified most myths about “sleep timing,” “sleep duration,” and “behaviors during sleep,” while it had varying degrees of success with other categories such as “pre-sleep behaviors” and “brain function and sleep.” ChatGPT’s assessment of the degree of falseness and public health significance, on the 5-point Likert scale, revealed an average score of 3.45 (SD 0.87) and 3.15 (SD 0.99), respectively, indicating a good level of accuracy in identifying the falseness of statements and a good understanding of their impact on public health. The AI-based tool showed a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value of 100%. Overall, this indicates that when ChatGPT labels a statement as false, it is highly reliable, but it may miss identifying some false statements. When comparing with expert ratings, high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between ChatGPT’s appraisals and expert opinions could be found, suggesting that the AI’s ratings were generally aligned with expert views on falseness (ICC=.83, P<.001) and public health significance (ICC=.79, P=.001) of sleep-related myths. Qualitatively, both ChatGPT and sleep experts refuted sleep-related misconceptions. However, ChatGPT adopted a more accessible style and provided a more generalized view, focusing on broad concepts, while experts sometimes used technical jargon, providing evidence-based explanations. Conclusions ChatGPT-4 can accurately address sleep-related queries and debunk sleep-related myths, with a performance comparable to sleep experts, even if, given its limitations, the AI cannot completely replace expert opinions, especially in nuanced and complex fields such as sleep health, but can be a valuable complement in the dissemination of updated information and promotion of healthy behaviors.",JMIR Formative Research,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.2196/55762

Generative language models have witnessed substantial traction, notably with the introduction of refined models aimed at more coherent user-AI interactions—principally conversational models. The epitome of this public attention has arguably been the refinement of the GPT-3 model into ChatGPT and its subsequent integration with auxiliary capabilities such as search features in Microsoft Bing. Despite voluminous prior research devoted to its developmental trajectory, the model’s performance, and applicability to a myriad of quotidian tasks remained nebulous and task specific. In terms of technological implementation, the advent of models such as LLMv2 and ChatGPT-4 has elevated the discourse beyond mere textual coherence to nuanced contextual understanding and real-world task completion. Concurrently, emerging architectures that focus on interpreting latent spaces have offered more granular control over text generation, thereby amplifying the model’s applicability across various verticals. Within the purview of cyber defense, especially in the Swiss operational ecosystem, these models pose both unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Their capabilities in data analytics, intrusion detection, and even misinformation combatting is laudable; yet the ethical and security implications concerning data privacy, surveillance, and potential misuse warrant judicious scrutiny.

Not since the advent of the digital age has the world faced a transformation of such magnitude. With the widely available user-friendly free and low-cost products of Open AI, the US AI research laboratory, the effects are being felt throughout multiple sectors, including scientific research and clinical care. Anyone with internet access can sign up at OpenAI.com to access a free research version of ChatGPT, a generative AI large-language model that interacts with the user in a natural language format (1). Powered by the world’s fifth largest supercomputer (2), ChatGPT gathers information using artificial neural network technology (3). Trained using large databases, it has an enormous vocabulary and is capable of understanding language and context, retrieving knowledge, generating new content in the forms of text and code, carrying on a conversation, and personalizing communications. While trained primarily in English, this chatbot supports 95 languages. While this tool became only recently available, ChatGPT gained traction immediately and gained followers at an unprecedented pace, attracting more than 100 million users in the two months following its public release in November 2022 (3). In March 2023, OpenAI released a more advanced multi-modal version, GPT-4, available through the paid service, ChatGPT Plus (4,5). To explore these new tools, we posed general queries to GPT-4 about the potential for generative AI to influence spinal cord research and clinical care. Selected responses are excerpted below: • Generative AI can be used to create virtual models of the human body, including the spinal cord, the musculoskeletal system, and the nervous system. These models can then be used to simulate spinal cord injury and test the effectiveness of different treatments in a more controlled and accurate environment. • AI algorithms can help researchers optimize the design of spinal stimulation protocols by analyzing large amounts of data, simulating the effects of stimulation, developing personalized treatment plans, and predicting outcomes. • Generative AI can be used to design new drugs that enhance the survival and integration of stem cells into the spinal cord. AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data to identify potential drug candidates and simulate their effects • By optimizing the design and control algorithms of robotic exoskeletons, analyzing large amounts of data, and simulating different types of injuries, generative AI can help researchers improve the effectiveness of these devices. By analyzing medical history and imaging data, AI algorithms can recommend the most effective exoskeleton design and treatment protocol for that individual’s specific injury and needs. When asked about its potential role in recruiting research participants, it responded: • AI algorithms can analyze electronic medical records, patient data, and social media activity to identify potential candidates for spinal cord injury studies. Once potential candidates have been identified, AI algorithms can be used to create personalized messages and content tailored to individual patients. Generative AI can be used to develop predictive models that identify factors associated with patient enrollment and retention. Generative AI can be used to engage with patients, using chatbots, virtual assistants, or other AI-powered tools to provide patients with updates, answer questions, and address concerns. ChatGPT offered these potential applications when queried about clinical care: • In acute spinal cord injury care, generative AI can analyze vital signs, lab results, and other patient data to predict the likelihood of pressure sores, urinary tract infections, or other complications. This can help clinicians intervene early, which can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs,",Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine (JSCM),2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1080/10790268.2023.2198926

We explore the use of generative AI to communicate technical information about low-carbon energy sources to the general public, specifically in the realm of nuclear energy. We explored 20 AI-powered text-to-image generators and compared their individual performances on general and scientific nuclear-related prompts. Of these models, DALL-E, DreamStudio, and Craiyon demonstrated promising performance in generating relevant images from general-level text related to nuclear topics. However, these models fall short in three crucial ways: (1) they fail to accurately represent technical details of energy systems; (2) they reproduce existing biases surrounding gender and work in the energy sector; and (3) they fail to accurately represent indigenous landscapes -- which have historically been sites of resource extraction and waste deposition for energy industries.

What legal gaps should be filled in to minimize such risks?Methods: comparative legal analysis, sociological method, concrete sociological method, quantitative data analysis, qualitative data analysis, statistical analysis, case study, induction, deduction.Results: the authors identified several risks of the unregulated usage of generative artificial intelligence in the creative industry, among which are: violation of copyright and labor law, violation of consumers rights and the rise of public distrust in government. They suggest that a prompt development of new legal norms can minimize these risks. In conclusion, the article constants that states have already begun to realize that the negative impact of generative artificial intelligence on the creative industry must not be ignored, hence the development of similar legal regulations in states with completely different regimes.Scientific novelty: the article provides a comprehensive study of the impact of generative artificial intelligence on the creative industry from two perspectives: the perspective of law and the perspective of the industry. The empirical basis of it consists of two international surveys and an expert opinion of a representative of the industry. This approach allowed the authors to improve the objectivity of their research and to obtain results that can be used for finding a practical solution for the identified risks. The problem of the ongoing development and popularization of generative artificial intelligence systems goes beyond the question “who is the author?” therefore, it needs to be solved by introduction of other than the already existing mechanisms and regulations - this point of view is supported not only by the results of the surveys but also by the analysis of current lawsuits against developers of generative artificial intelligence systems.Practical significance: the obtained results can be used to fasten the development of universal legal rules, regulations, instruments and standards, the current lack of which poses a threat not only to human rights, but also to several sectors within the creative industry and beyond.",Journal of Digital Technologies and Law,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.21202/jdtl.2023.38

The AASW Social Work Practice Standards (AASW, 2023) calls on social workers to be critically reflective, ethical practitioners engaged in lifelong professional development and learning. Equally, social work education seeks to prepare students for research-informed, culturally-responsive practice across a diverse range of contexts, and in this Issue, we showcase critical social work education and practice diversity. However, a different ethical challenge to integrity and practice standards is the focus of this Editorial. Here, we highlight some of the concerns and implications of generative Artificial Intelligence (generative AI) for social work education, research, practice, and scholarly publishing. In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a generative AI Large Language Model (LLM) that could generate realistic and natural text outputs from simple prompts. This technology had been in development for some time but had not been released to the public for general use. Since then, there has been a proliferation of different AI models that can generate and augment text, images, video, and audio. Generative AI is being used to perform analytical and interpretive tasks such as language translation; responding to queries on specific data sources, coding, and interpreting code; summarising documents and webpages; and creating case assessments and plans. This technology can be used to construct legal documents; machine learning for facial recognition; and for undertaking medical, mental health, and other diagnostic assessments. These are just some examples. In this fast-moving field, the uses and applications seem endless. The open-sourcing of generative AI models and their underlying architecture means developers are starting to create a myriad of practical applications and tools that rapidly increase the depth and scale of automation, potentially replacing or augmenting many everyday tasks normally performed by humans. The implications for social work education, practice, research, and scholarship are extensive. As with any new technology, there are a range of stances, from early adopters to positions that have resonance with luddism. This adds to the complexities of responding to AI as a whole profession. Nevertheless, what is clear is that the rise and integration of generative AI systems, at scale, will yield a wide range of practical, ethical, and epistemological problems for many professions, including social work. It is to some of these problems we turn our attention below. Beginning with social work education, generative AI will have profound effects on assessment and learning for higher education providers. It is likely to cause educators to re-evaluate their educational practices, assessments, and assumptions about what is core to a social work curriculum.

These services commonly employ prompts to steer the generative process, and both the prompts and the resultant content, such as text and images, may harbor privacy-sensitive or confidential information, thereby elevating security and privacy risks. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce $\Lambda$-Split, a split computing framework to facilitate computational offloading while simultaneously fortifying data privacy against risks such as eavesdropping and unauthorized access. In $\Lambda$-Split, a generative model, usually a deep neural network (DNN), is partitioned into three sub-models and distributed across the user's local device and a cloud server: the input-side and output-side sub-models are allocated to the local, while the intermediate, computationally-intensive sub-model resides on the cloud server. This architecture ensures that only the hidden layer outputs are transmitted, thereby preventing the external transmission of privacy-sensitive raw input and output data. Given the black-box nature of DNNs, estimating the original input or output from intercepted hidden layer outputs poses a significant challenge for malicious eavesdroppers. Moreover, $\Lambda$-Split is orthogonal to traditional encryption-based security mechanisms, offering enhanced security when deployed in conjunction. We empirically validate the efficacy of the $\Lambda$-Split framework using Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion XL, representative large language and diffusion models developed by Meta and Stability AI, respectively.

But AI ethics is not only a technical risk assessment and accounting effort, or an application of general principles to stable artifacts. It is also a social self-diagnosis, a contested and contestable assertion of values and desirable futures, and a selective understanding of the nature of AI in its different forms. In expressions of concern and efforts at preparation for increasingly powerful AI tools, we can trace the ways we imagine ourselves and our society to be compatible with AI's promises and susceptible to its dangers. The problems we notice, and the solutions we offer, arise from the interaction of these imagined elements. The socially embedded efficacy of AI tools leads many commentators to imagine their risks specifically in conjunction with understandings of society as it currently is and imaginations of how it can and should exist in the future [1]. The sense-making moves performed in the wake of developments in generative AI are thus a site to examine the movement and uses of different concepts brought together in this domain: the human, rationality, and the place of expertise. As these sense-making efforts are carried out, they become constraints on how the risks of generative AI can be noticed and understood. The problems raised by generative AI are so fundamentally tied to its performance as a simulator of human interpersonal acts that we should ask: where is the risk of generative AI located, such that the utility and the safety of the tools can be preserved after troubling cases? Boundaries between malicious deception and magnificent design are unclear without an answer to this question. Thus, to fit generative AI into our world, we are trying to answer it; this is one goal of efforts at regulation which seeks to allow the benefits of imitation to arrive while avoiding the harms of deception. In the current regulation, reporting, and corporate responses to generative AI, the challenge of safely introducing generative AI is being approached in large part as a challenge of producing the right kind of knowledge in its users. Below is a summary of my findings from three cases, chosen to investigate the following question: What ways, or whose ways, of using, knowing, and understanding generative AI are being offered as appropriate? I examine the EU AI Act language reflecting disclosure requirements for interactions with generative AI, responses to a chatbot-facilitated suicide in Belgium, and reactions to expert claims of a chatbot's sentience. In the first two cases, AI-generated content is problematic insofar as users are uninformed about its provenance or maliciously deceived by it, while users who know they are interacting with AI but behave problematically are designated as deluded or irrational. In the third case, a Google engineer who presents evidence to support claims that AI is sentient is censured as nationwide reporting denounces his claim against an expert consensus from which he is ejected. In all three cases, challenges facing widespread generative AI development and use are avoided by attending to the knowledge and understanding of those who use them rather than the functioning of the tools themselves. The EU AI Act is illuminating as a general and authoritative account of how AI interactions can be made safe, requiring first and foremost that users are informed. [2, 3] The AI Act is useful in the present paper as it shows the effort to match and reconcile a new technology with an extant set of values, chief among which is autonomy. Its reliance on disclosure reflects a general sense that harms are acceptable or unacceptable not on the basis of outcomes but based on the degree of autonomy possessed by the actors in question. Rational actors in a simulated environment are responsible for the effects of the simulation, so long as they are informed of the nature of that environment and have essentially consented to consume deceptive or false content. The other two cases I examine explore this very issue, of problematic understandings and behavior on the part of knowing users. The first of these is the case of the Belgian man. After his suicide responses from the company which provided the chatbot, media [4, 5, 6] and government [5], and prominent expert AI ethics commentary [7] characterized it as arising because the user was vulnerable and consequently did not relate to the bot in the right way. While the chatbot's emotionally charged language was seen as a part of the problem, in the reporting on this event the unanimous emphasis on the man's mental state presents the risk as arising in an interaction, in a pathological mistake of the user, rather than in the tool. Locating risk is a necessary and immensely powerful, if often unexamined step which precedes intervention in a worrisome state of affairs: where we locate risk is where we intervene. If the risk accompanying generative AI is located in the minds of uninformed or misapprehending users, disclosures and disclaimers are indeed sensible interventions. In this conception, when knowledge fails to protect the user, it is not a failed safeguard but a bad user. Problematizing user understandings in this way provides an exonerating resource for the companies providing these tools and suggests the rectitude of expert authority on the nature of these tools, by linking delays and dangers in generative AI to users who do not abide by the (strategically underdetermined) expert consensus on generative AI's accuracy, capabilities, and nature. My third case examines how the expert consensus around generative AI is maintained through the story of Blake Lemoine, who publicly announced his belief that Google's LaMDA model had become sentient and was presented by major media outlets and experts as deluded [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In the media and corporate response to Lemoine, wherein Google questioned his sanity before firing him [13], we see his ejection from the community of experts permitted to call for greater scrutiny based on qualitative changes in the nature of these models. He becomes a layperson on account of his anthropomorphizing error. In this act of boundary work [14], policing who is in the body of experts qualified to decide on the sentience of the chatbot, and the nature of AI models in general, we must notice how small this group truly is and what Lemoine's ejection preserves. If safeguards like those Lemoine called for should follow on the kind of change he claimed to detect, and those outside Google's leadership could determine when such changes have arrived, Google would cease to lead the conversation on regulation by defining the nature of its technology. This state of affairs leaves the right relations with generative AI underdetermined but maintains that positions which challenge the expert consensus are the result of misunderstandings so significant as to disqualify the concerned party's thoughts on the matter from rational consideration. In the three cases examined here, events and concerns which threaten to depict generative AI as in need of significant scrutiny or changes are defused not by intervening in the company's technology, but by delineating between user understandings which are empowered and exploitative, safe and vulnerable, rational and deluded. Named after an early chatbot, the ELIZA effect refers to the readiness with which users anthropomorphize computer systems [15]. Reporting on both Lemoine [11] and the Belgian man cited this effect [6]. The chatbot which encouraged the Belgian man to commit suicide was named Eliza. One way of summarizing the change I trace in the cases described above is a transition away from the Turing test and towards the ELIZA effect as the conceptual frame for AI which imitates humans. While the Turing test implies the layperson's relevance to the discussion and regulation of AI, the ELIZA effect implies their irrelevance. This project will continue as an effort to follow popular, expert, and regulatory perceptions of the risk of generative AI as the tools themselves and the public concern surrounding them continue to develop. The resources of science and technology studies (STS) enable crucial perspectives on numerous ways of thinking about AI and the challenges of its development and regulation such as the common citations of law lag, invocations of self-regulation in the mode of the Asilomar Conference on rDNA, collective action problem framings, and more. The STS literature on sociotechnical imaginaries [1] and public understandings of science [16] contribute to the present insight as to how the efforts of tech-society reconciliation and risk-benefit balancing presented as appropriate for AI reveal and produce our understandings of the technology, even as they reproduce and reshape social norms. There is an urgent need for work which extends this powerful scholarly tradition for understanding science, technology, and society to AI, as one of the most important and concerning technological developments of our moment.","AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1145/3600211.3604744

This research is intended to provide an initial solution to the problem of finding images for processing by photogrammetry in special cases where these do not exist. An overview of existing artificial intelligence-based algorithms that enable the extension of source image dataset is reported. In particular, this research focused on the use of prompt-to-image systems for obtaining images to be used in reconstruction and then in the next step of 3D modelling. Thus, the combined use of these three techniques, AI, photogrammetry, and modelling allowed the creation of a model of a building that never existed except in the collective imagination, which is the tower of Babel. In particular, the case study chosen is the illustration in Kircher book present in the library of the Brixen seminary that is closed to the public and for which it was necessary to create a tool to enhance the value and knowledge of this heritage for external users. Therefore, the creation of an augmented reality app enabled the visualization of the model created by offering possibilities for immersive experiences and dissemination of the research to a wide audience.

This study tries to clarify what artificial intelligence (AI) is, how it could affect corporate sectors and SME operations, and India's adoption challenges. Governments can help SMEs develop their risk supervision procedures. Most industries can benefit from using AI, although some are more likely to do so than others. AI may be used in several business areas and can alter the internal value chain of the company. The areas of business where artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to have the most effects. Objective: It is necessary to create the circumstances for a reliable transition and increase knowledge of the benefits of AI among SME managers and employees. A participative approach should be taken when revamping work processes and training AI models, and national and local governments should coordinate efforts to reskill SME managers and employees. Then, until AI can fulfil its full potential, mechanisms for bridging the financing gap should be identified. Research Methodology: The study's foundations include both qualitative and quantitative research. Regulators and policymakers should make sure that knowledge markets that offer cloud solutions with embedded AI technologies are operating smoothly. Findings: The findings of the research are based on the role and impact of AI on different aspects of governance like public administration, tax compliances, market competition, infrastructure, finances, labor market etc. Conclusion: AI lowers prediction costs significantly and makes decision-making easier. To map uncertainties and reduce risk exposure, SMEs may use predictive analytics. They can also automate business estimates, including sales and budget forecasts, or improve the effectiveness of asset maintenance and management. Greater market segmentation and price differentiation are made possible by improved prediction capabilities, which also provide SMEs the chance to innovate since they are better able to foresee customer behavior and price sensitivity as well as demand changes.","Kaav International Journal of Law, Finance &amp; Industrial Relations",2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.52458/23492589.2023.v10.iss1.kp.a1

Browser-based IR solutions powered by AI for personalised recommendations-based information retrieval, such as the Google search engine, were one of the early examples. The IR field has advanced to its next level with the newest conversational applications based on large language model (LLM) techniques. It is becoming clear that Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) applications such as ChatGPT will significantly impact information retrieval behaviour in the education sector. Though this application has become widespread in acclaim, no previous study has shown its impact on information seeking and retrieval. However, based on the observation of the fast penetration of this technology and the growth of public interest, a pre-assumption was built that it is essential to investigate if students may also be showing a similar interest in this new tool. Hence, this study is set up to systematically and empirically explore how ChatGPT influences the IR behaviour of students in HEIs. A survey approach is utilised to collect the perceived IR behaviour through a questionnaire administered to 60 students in HEIs. The findings reveal that the tool is already widely known among HEI students. They also perceived the use of the tool in the context of information retrieval and proclaimed its usefulness, acknowledging its efficiency (reduced time) in finding information. Furthermore, the technology has considerably affected the typical use of other conventional information retrieval and search engine tools. On the contrary, 10% of the respondents are less likely to use ChatGPT during information seeking for various reasons, from credibility and relevance to technology infrastructure issues such as connectivity. Although a deeper analysis is required to establish a general conclusion on how and in which ways GPT-based models will override contemporary IR practices, the study outcome provides evidence for a possible behavioural change among HEI students in their IR habits in the future.",European Conference on e-Learning,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.34190/ecel.22.1.1831

This change, which we could consider paradigmatic, has been promoted by various factors which mutually magnify each other's effects. 
In recent years the massive collection and storage of data has intensified through ubiquitous technologies, which co-exist with human actors. In addition, we have witnessed an increase in the intentional processing power of this data at a speed unimaginable a few years ago (through the application of Artificial Intelligence, hereafter AI) . This has turned many aspects of our lives into data, from which value is extracted by third parties through processes of datafication. Concurrently, the public at large - including the educational sector - has been promised educational ‘personalisation’, a concept derived directly from other industrial production scenarios where AI is already in use, and every experience is datafied. In addition, a rapidly growing economic sector - the EdTech industry - has emerged with a capacity to monetise the educational sphere at a global level, extracting not only profits from its present and future actions with private or institutional clients, but also generating income based on capturing the motivation of their users and achieving significant levels of social and political influence. All of the above is magnified by the proliferation of the use of online platforms and tools in educational spaces (such as learning analytics and online exam proctoring), accelerated by the demand for online educaiton resulting from ‘lockdowns’ during the CoVid-19 pandemic. 
This special issue aims to bring together articles that problematise the challenges and unintended effects that new mechanisms and dynamics fuelled by these data-driven technologies have introduced into education. This call aims to encourage researchers and practitioners to share studies, research, debates and academically well-founded reflections that propose critical visions. This aims to provide those who are interested in education (either as teachers, academic faculty, researchers or managers ) deeper analyses, to allow us to understand the current educational and technological landscape, and to foster a revaluation of relevant educational issues that should be part of our work in the coming years.",Edutec.

Modern digital platforms and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), introduce novel risks in crisis management (Guthrie and Rich, 2022). Disinformation literature in security and computer science has assessed how previously introduced technologies have affected disinformation, demanding a systematic and coordinated approach for sustainable counter-disinformation efforts. However, there is a lack of theory-driven, evidence-based research and practice in public relations that advises how organizations can effectively and proactively manage risks and crises driven by AI (Guthrie and Rich, 2022).Design/methodology/approachAs a first step in closing this research-practice gap, the authors first synthesize theoretical and technical literature characterizing the effects of AI on disinformation. Upon this review, the authors propose a conceptual framework for disinformation response in the corporate sector that assesses (1) technologies affecting disinformation attacks and counterattacks and (2) how organizations can proactively prepare and equip communication teams to better protect businesses and stakeholders.FindingsThis research illustrates that future disinformation response efforts will not be able to rely solely on detection strategies, as AI-created content quality becomes more and more convincing (and ultimately, indistinguishable), and that future disinformation management efforts will need to rely on content influence rather than volume (due to emerging capabilities for automated production of disinformation). Built upon these fundamental, literature-driven characteristics, the framework provides organizations actor-level and content-level perspectives for influence and discusses their implications for disinformation management.Originality/valueThis research provides a theoretical basis and practitioner insights by anticipating how AI technologies will impact corporate disinformation attacks and outlining how companies can respond. The proposed framework provides a theory-driven, practical approach for effective, proactive disinformation management systems with the capacity and agility to detect risks and mitigate crises driven by evolving AI technologies. Together, this framework and the discussed strategies offer great value to forward-looking disinformation management efforts. Subsequent research can build upon this framework as AI technologies are deployed in disinformation campaigns, and practitioners can leverage this framework in the development of counter-disinformation efforts.",Journal of Communication Management,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1108/jcom-09-2022-0113

It is known from the literature on AI in medicine that patients and the public hold relatively strong preferences in relation to desirable features of AI systems and their implementation, e.g. in relation to explainability and accuracy, and in relation to the role of the human decision-maker in the decision chain. The features that are preferred can be seen as ‘protective’ of the patient’s interests. These types of preferences may plausibly vary across decision-making contexts, but the research on this question has so far been almost exclusively performed in relation to medical AI. In this cross-sectional survey study we investigate the preferences of the adult Danish population for five specific protective features of AI systems and implementation across a range of eight different use cases in the public and commercial sectors ranging from medical diagnostics to the issuance of parking tickets. We find that all five features are seen as important across all eight contexts, but that they are deemed to be slightly less important when the implications of the decision made are less significant to the respondents.",PLoS ONE,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1371/journal.pone.0295277

In response to these growing threats, public and private sectors have prioritized the strengthening of IT security measures. In light of the growing security concern, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained prominence within the cybersecurity landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in AI-driven threat response systems. To the best of our knowledge, the most recent survey covering the AI reaction domain was conducted in 2017. Since then, considerable literature has been published, and therefore, it is worth reviewing it. In this comprehensive survey of the state of the art reaction systems, five key features with multiple values have been identified, facilitating a homogeneous comparison between the different works. In addition, through a meticulous methodology of article collection, the 22 most relevant publications in the field have been selected. Then each of these publications has been subjected to a detailed analysis using the features identified, which has allowed for the generation of a comprehensive overview revealing significant relationships between the papers.

The variety of change management theories and approaches that are currently available, however, paints a complicated picture that is plagued by inconsistencies, a lack of strong empirical support, and unproven assumptions about contemporary organizational dynamics. This essay seeks to set the basis for a fresh paradigm for effective change administration by critically analyzing popular change management ideas. The gap between theory and practice is addressed in the paper, which concludes with suggestions for more research. In parallel, artificial intelligence (AI) has made incredible progress, giving rise to computers that mimic human autonomy and cognition. Industry-wide excitement has been sparked by the enthusiasm among academics, executives, and the general public, which has resulted in significant investments in utilizing AI's potential through creative business models. However, the lack of thorough academic guidance forces managers to struggle with AI integration issues, increasing the risk of project failure. An in-depth analysis of AI's complexities and its function as a spark for revolutionary business model innovation is provided in this article. A thorough literature assessment, which involves sifting through a sizable library of published works, combines up-to-date information on how AI is affecting the development of new business models. The findings come together to form a roadmap for seamless AI integration that includes four steps: understanding the fundamentals of AI and the skills needed for digital transformation, understanding current business models and their innovation potential, nurturing key proficiencies for AI assimilation, and gaining organizational acceptance while developing internal competencies. This article combines the fields of organizational change management and AI-driven business model innovation with ease, providing a thorough explanation to assist businesses in undergoing a successful transformation and innovation. These disciplines' confluence offers a practical vantage point for successfully adapting to, thriving in, and profiting within a dynamic business environment. Artificial intelligence (AI), a massively disruptive force that is altering international businesses, is at the vanguard of this revolution. The ability of AI to make decisions automatically, based on data analysis and observation, opens up hitherto untapped possibilities for value creation and competitive dominance, with broad consequences spanning several industries. With its quick scaling, ongoing improvement, and self-learning capabilities, this evolutionary invention functions as an agile capital-labor hybrid. Significantly, AI's architecture serves as the cornerstone for data-driven decision support by deftly sifting through large and complicated datasets to extract insights. Thus, the symbiotic marriage of organizational change management and AI-driven business model innovation gives a thorough narrative, directing businesses towards not just surviving, but thriving in an ever-evolving business environment. It is underlined how business models (BMs) interact with technology to affect how well business’s function, underlining the need of taking BMs into account while using AI. Business model innovation (BMI) that AI unlocks may improve goods, streamline processes, and save costs. However, there is a void between technological improvements and their operationalization via BMs. Successful AI integration depends on a well-structured BM, which promotes agility and makes the most of technological resources. BMI is accelerated by AI, which reshapes sectors via innovation. Although interest in AI is high, strategic, cultural, and technological constraints sometimes prevent large investments from producing positive economic results. To fully utilize AI's capabilities, structured BMs are required. Despite an increase in research, there is still little cohesive information about the business uses of AI. In an effort to close this gap, we examine implementation-related AI problems. Analyzing AI-driven BM transformation and risk management is aided by a study on BMI and digital transformation at the same time. The purpose of this study is to further our understanding of AI-driven business model innovation and to provide a useful framework to help practitioners navigate the potential and difficulties of AI implementation.

Owing to the current competitive and fast economy, which generates huge demand for increasingly efficient, reliable, and transparent intelligent systems, decision-support architectures should also be developed under strong restrictions of cost and time. Such a context requires adequate structures, processes, and technologies for coping with the complexity of building such intelligent systems. Currently, many public organizations have adopted applications for process automation, with the aim of refraining from repetitive work and producing more efficient results. However, what is not so often observed is the development of intelligent engines to support complex public decision-making. Possible explanations are the plethora of available data sources and the number of legal norms to be abided by. Moreover, it is important to highlight the need to incorporate transparency, auditability, reusability, and flexibility into such systems. Thus, they can be safely utilized in various analogous situations, reducing the need to develop new applications from scratch. An architecture suitable for supporting public decision-making with so many features and increasingly unstructured data, as well as abundant regulation, needs well-crafted formal specifications. This article aims to analyze three existing frameworks and carry out domain engineering studies in three cases to produce some guidance for future public applications and services based on AI. Next, we provide a conceptual preliminary architectural definition for the public sector. The proposed architecture targets were identified in the three cases studied, namely, frequent tasks of process mining requirements, detection of anomalies, and extraction of rules and public policies for helping public servants.

AI tools are increasingly accessed by clients and service users. Mental health professionals must be prepared not only to use AI but also to have conversations about it when delivering care. Despite the potential for AI to enable more efficient and reliable and higher-quality care delivery, there is a persistent gap among mental health professionals in the adoption of AI. Objective A needs assessment was conducted among mental health professionals to (1) understand the learning needs of the workforce and their attitudes toward AI and (2) inform the development of AI education curricula and knowledge translation products. Methods A qualitative descriptive approach was taken to explore the needs of mental health professionals regarding their adoption of AI through semistructured interviews. To reach maximum variation sampling, mental health professionals (eg, psychiatrists, mental health nurses, educators, scientists, and social workers) in various settings across Ontario (eg, urban and rural, public and private sector, and clinical and research) were recruited. Results A total of 20 individuals were recruited. Participants included practitioners (9/20, 45% social workers and 1/20, 5% mental health nurses), educator scientists (5/20, 25% with dual roles as professors/lecturers and researchers), and practitioner scientists (3/20, 15% with dual roles as researchers and psychiatrists and 2/20, 10% with dual roles as researchers and mental health nurses). Four major themes emerged: (1) fostering practice change and building self-efficacy to integrate AI into patient care; (2) promoting system-level change to accelerate the adoption of AI in mental health; (3) addressing the importance of organizational readiness as a catalyst for AI adoption; and (4) ensuring that mental health professionals have the education, knowledge, and skills to harness AI in optimizing patient care. Conclusions AI technologies are starting to emerge in mental health care. Although many digital tools, web-based services, and mobile apps are designed using AI algorithms, mental health professionals have generally been slower in the adoption of AI. As indicated by this study’s findings, the implications are 3-fold. At the individual level, digital professionals must see the value in digitally compassionate tools that retain a humanistic approach to care. For mental health professionals, resistance toward AI adoption must be acknowledged through educational initiatives to raise awareness about the relevance, practicality, and benefits of AI. At the organizational level, digital professionals and leaders must collaborate on governance and funding structures to promote employee buy-in. At the societal level, digital and mental health professionals should collaborate in the creation of formal AI training programs specific to mental health to address knowledge gaps. This study promotes the design of relevant and sustainable education programs to support the adoption of AI within the mental health care sphere.",JMIR Formative Research,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.2196/47847

AI also has strong synergy with the information privacy (IP) domain from two distinct aspects: as a protection tool (i.e., safeguarding privacy), and as a threat tool (i.e., compromising privacy). In the former case, AI techniques are amalgamated with the traditional anonymization techniques to improve various key components of the anonymity process, and therefore, privacy is safeguarded effectively. In the latter case, some adversarial knowledge is aggregated with the help of AI techniques and subsequently used to compromise the privacy of individuals. To the best of our knowledge, threats posed by AI-generated knowledge such as synthetic data (SD) to information privacy are often underestimated, and most of the existing anonymization methods do not consider/model this SD-based knowledge that can be available to the adversary, leading to privacy breaches in some cases. In this paper, we highlight the role of AI as a threat tool (i.e., AI used to compromise an individual’s privacy), with a special focus on SD that can serve as background knowledge leading to various kinds of privacy breaches. For instance, SD can encompass pertinent information (e.g., total # of attributes in data, distributions of sensitive information, category values of each attribute, minor and major values of some attributes, etc.) about real data that can offer a helpful hint to the adversary regarding the composition of anonymized data, that can subsequently lead to uncovering the identity or private information. We perform reasonable experiments on a real-life benchmark dataset to prove the pitfalls of AI in the data publishing scenario (when a database is either fully or partially released to public domains for conducting analytics).",IEEE Access,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3297646

Scope 3 emissions had the largest share in total annual emissions with an average share of 52%, followed by Scope 2 (32%) and Scope 1 (16%). Because of the absence of a standardized methodology for Scope 3 emissions estimation, each company used different methodologies that resulted in differences in emissions values. An analysis of the CDP reporting data did not reveal information on strategies implemented by companies to reduce Scope 3 emissions. The use of renewable energy certificates had the largest effect on decarbonization centered on reducing Scope 2 emissions, followed by the deployment of perfluorocarbon reduction technologies to help reduce Scope 1 fugitive emissions.

Here, we present variations of fragment-based reinforcement learning using an actor-critic model. Novel features include freezing fragments and using reagents as the fragment source. Splitting molecules according to reaction schemes improves synthesizability, while tuning network output probabilities allows us to balance novelty versus diversity. Combining fragment-based optimization with virtual library encodings allows the exploration of large chemical spaces with synthesizable ideas. Collectively, these enhancements influence design toward high-quality molecules with favorable profiles. A validation study using 15 pharmaceutically relevant targets reveals that novel structures are obtained for most cases, which are identical or related to independent validation sets for each target.

The early detection of breast cancer using medical imaging techniques helps reduce the number of deaths caused by this disease. Thermogram imaging is safer and less expensive than mammography for diagnosing breast cancer. The automated analysis of thermogram images using artificial intelligence (AI) methods is an interesting approach to detect breast cancer. This article proposes a novel multiscale analysis domain interpretable deep learning (MSADIDL) approach for automatically detecting breast cancer using thermogram images. The 2D empirical wavelet transform (2DEWT) with fixed boundary points (FBPs) is employed for the multiscale analysis of thermogram images and evaluation of modes or subbands. All the modes of the thermogram images are used as the input to the MSADIDL model for the automated detection of breast cancer. The MSADIDL architecture comprises seven individual deep neural networks (DNNs) connected in parallel. The outputs of the individual DNNs are concatenated and then used as the input to the dense layers, after which the output layer evaluates the probability score for the automated categorization of normal versus cancerous classes. A publicly available thermogram imaging dataset is utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed MSADIDL approach. The results show that the proposed MSADIDL approach has obtained an accuracy value of 99.54% for both fivefold cross-validation (CV) and hold-out validation cases using all seven modes of thermogram images. The MSADIDL model has achieved an accuracy higher than all of the transfer learning-based breast cancer detection techniques using thermogram images.

The concise formulation of these laws is a crucial objective in scientific research and an important challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). While traditional artificial neural networks (MLP) excel at data fitting, they often yield uninterpretable black box results that hinder our understanding of the relationship between variables x and predicted values y. Moreover, the fixed network architecture in MLP often gives rise to redundancy in both network structure and parameters. To address these issues, we propose MetaSymNet, a novel neural network that dynamically adjusts its structure in real-time, allowing for both expansion and contraction. This adaptive network employs the PANGU meta function as its activation function, which is a unique type capable of evolving into various basic functions during training to compose mathematical formulas tailored to specific needs. We then evolve the neural network into a concise, interpretable mathematical expression. To evaluate MetaSymNet's performance, we compare it with four state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms across more than 10 public datasets comprising 222 formulas. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms others consistently regardless of noise presence or absence. Furthermore, we assess MetaSymNet against MLP and SVM regarding their fitting ability and extrapolation capability, these are two essential aspects of machine learning algorithms. The findings reveal that our algorithm excels in both areas. Finally, we compared MetaSymNet with MLP using iterative pruning in network structure complexity.

This study built artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically identify and correct news headlines exaggerating obesity-related research findings. Design/methodology/approach We searched popular digital media outlets to collect 523 headlines exaggerating obesity-related research findings. The reasons for exaggerations include: inferring causality from observational studies, inferring human outcomes from animal research, inferring distant/end outcomes (e.g., obesity) from immediate/intermediate outcomes (e.g., calorie intake), and generalizing findings to the population from a subgroup or convenience sample. Each headline was paired with the title and abstract of the peer-reviewed journal publication covered by the news article. We drafted an exaggeration-free counterpart for each original headline and fined-tuned a BERT model to differentiate between them. We further fine-tuned three generative language models—BART, PEGASUS, and T5 to autogenerate exaggeration-free headlines based on a journal publication’s title and abstract. Model performance was evaluated using the ROUGE metrics by comparing model-generated headlines with journal publication titles. Findings The fine-tuned BERT model achieved 92.5% accuracy in differentiating between exaggeration-free and original headlines. Baseline ROUGE scores averaged 0.311 for ROUGE-1, 0.113 for ROUGE-2, 0.253 for ROUGE-L, and 0.253 ROUGE-Lsum. PEGASUS, T5, and BART all outperformed the baseline.

The risk of misdiagnosis may exist due to human factors such as lack of time, fatigue, and relatively low experience. Deep learning methods have become increasingly important in MRI classification. To improve diagnostic accuracy, researchers emphasize the need to develop Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) computational diagnostics based on artificial intelligence (AI) systems by using deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and improving the performance of CNN by combining it with other data analysis tools such as wavelet transform. In this study, a novel diagnostic framework based on CNN and DWT data analysis is developed for the diagnosis of glioma tumors in the brain, among other tumors and other diseases, with T2-SWI MRI scans. It is a binary CNN classifier that treats the disease “glioma tumor” as positive and the other pathologies as negative, resulting in a very unbalanced binary problem. The study includes a comparative analysis of a CNN trained with wavelet transform data of MRIs instead of their pixel intensity values in order to demonstrate the increased performance of the CNN and DWT analysis in diagnosing brain gliomas. The results of the proposed CNN architecture are also compared with a deep CNN pre-trained on VGG16 transfer learning network and with the SVM machine learning method using DWT knowledge. Methods: To improve the accuracy of the CNN classifier, the proposed CNN model uses as knowledge the spatial and temporal features extracted by converting the original MRI images to the frequency domain by performing Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), instead of the traditionally used original scans in the form of pixel intensities. Moreover, no pre-processing was applied to the original images. The images used are MRIs of type T2-SWI sequences parallel to the axial plane. Firstly, a compression step is applied for each MRI scan applying DWT up to three levels of decomposition. These data are used to train a 2D CNN in order to classify the scans as showing glioma or not. The proposed CNN model is trained on MRI slices originated from 382 various male and female adult patients, showing healthy and pathological images from a selection of diseases (showing glioma, meningioma, pituitary, necrosis, edema, non-enchasing tumor, hemorrhagic foci, edema, ischemic changes, cystic areas, etc.). The images are provided by the database of the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) and the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenges on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenges 2016 and 2017, as well as by the numerous records kept in the public general hospital of Chania, Crete, “Saint George”. Results: The proposed frameworks are experimentally evaluated by examining MRI slices originating from 190 different patients (not included in the training set), of which 56% are showing gliomas by the longest two axes less than 2 cm and 44% are showing other pathological effects or healthy cases. Results show convincing performance when using as information the spatial and temporal features extracted by the original scans. With the proposed CNN model and with data in DWT format, we achieved the following statistic percentages: accuracy 0.97, sensitivity (recall) 1, specificity 0.93, precision 0.95, FNR 0, and FPR 0.07. These numbers are higher for this data format (respectively: accuracy by 6% higher, recall by 11%, specificity by 7%, precision by 5%, FNR by 0.1%, and FPR is the same) than it would be, had we used as input data the intensity values of the MRIs (instead of the DWT analysis of the MRIs). Additionally, our study showed that when our CNN takes into account the TL of the existing network VGG, the performance values are lower, as follows: accuracy 0.87, sensitivity (recall) 0.91, specificity 0.84, precision 0.86, FNR of 0.08, and FPR 0.14. Conclusions: The experimental results show the outperformance of the CNN, which is not based on transfer learning, but is using as information the MRI brain scans decomposed into DWT information instead of the pixel intensity of the original scans. The results are promising for the proposed CNN based on DWT knowledge to serve for binary diagnosis of glioma tumors among other tumors and diseases. Moreover, the SVM learning model using DWT data analysis performs with higher accuracy and sensitivity than using pixel values.",Brain Science,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.3390/brainsci13020348

Statistical learning, a generalized framework from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is predestined for processing “Big Data” and holds the potential to revolutionize the field of laboratory medicine. Personalized medicine may in particular benefit from AI-based systems, especially when coupled with readily available wearables and smartphones which can collect health data from individual patients and offer new, cost-effective access routes to healthcare for patients worldwide. The amount of personal data collected, however, also raises concerns about patient-privacy and calls for clear ethical guidelines for “Big Data” research, including rigorous quality checks of data and algorithms to eliminate underlying bias and enable transparency. Likewise, novel federated privacy-preserving data processing approaches may reduce the need for centralized data storage. Generative AI-systems including large language models such as ChatGPT currently enter the stage to reshape clinical research, clinical decision-support systems, and healthcare delivery. In our opinion, AI-based systems have a tremendous potential to transform laboratory medicine, however, their opportunities should be weighed against the risks carefully. Despite all enthusiasm, we advocate for stringent added-value assessments, just as for any new drug or treatment. Human experts should carefully validate AI-based systems, including patient-privacy protection, to ensure quality, transparency, and public acceptance.

The entire world witnessed a severe ICU patient capacity crisis a few years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various widely utilized machine learning (ML) models in this research field can provide poor performance due to a lack of proper feature selection. Despite the fact that nature-based algorithms in other sectors perform well for feature selection, no comparative study on the performance of nature-based algorithms in feature selection has been conducted in the ICU mortality prediction field. Therefore, in this research, a comparison of the performance of ML models with and without feature selection was performed. In addition, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) was used to examine the contribution of features to the decision-making process. Explainable AI focuses on establishing transparency and traceability for statistical black-box machine learning techniques. Explainable AI is essential in the medical industry to foster public confidence and trust in machine learning model predictions. Three nature-based algorithms, namely the flower pollination algorithm (FPA), particle swarm algorithm (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA), were used in this study. For the classification job, the most widely used and diversified classifiers from the literature were used, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT) classifier, the gradient boosting (GB) algorithm, and the random forest (RF) algorithm. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset was used to collect data on heart failure patients. On the MIMIC-III dataset, it was discovered that feature selection significantly improved the performance of the described ML models. Without applying any feature selection process on the MIMIC-III heart failure patient dataset, the accuracy of the four mentioned ML models, namely LR, DT, RF, and GB was 69.9%, 82.5%, 90.6%, and 91.0%, respectively, whereas with feature selection in combination with the FPA, the accuracy increased to 71.6%, 84.8%, 92.8%, and 91.1%, respectively, for the same dataset. Again, the FPA showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) value of 83.0% with the RF algorithm among all other algorithms utilized in this study. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of feature selection with FPA has a profound impact on the outcome of ML models. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was used in this study to interpret the ML models. SHAP was used in this study because it offers mathematical assurances for the precision and consistency of explanations. It is trustworthy and suitable for both local and global explanations. It was found that the features that were selected by SHAP as most important were also most common with the features selected by the FPA. Therefore, we hope that this study will help physicians to predict ICU mortality for heart failure patients with a limited number of features and with high accuracy.",Applied Sciences,2023,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.3390/app13106138

In recent times, the concepts of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), Super AI, and Narrow AI have attracted considerable attention. Undoubtedly, the success of ChatGPT in capturing all attention has played a significant role in this. Artificial intelligence technology has a profound impact on all sectors, and sector representatives are striving to adapt to this technology more quickly. It is projected that artificial intelligence could generate an economic size of 13 trillion American dollars by 2030. Developments in artificial intelligence technologies undoubtedly lead to significant improvements in the functioning of public institutions and access for citizens. Artificial intelligence has the potential to be used in many public services, including security and defense, healthcare services, education, transportation and infrastructure, environmental and natural resource management, law and justice systems, among others. Therefore, evaluating the types of artificial intelligence, Narrow AI applications, and chatbots for public use is seen as highly beneficial from the perspective of public administration and the public sector. In our study, the topics of super artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence, narrow artificial intelligence, and chatbots have been extensively evaluated within the context of the public sector and public administration. Utilizing findings from both Turkish and English literature reviews, the importance and potential impacts of artificial intelligence within the public sector, along with current trends, have been comprehensively assessed. This research delves into the concepts of artificial intelligence and its subsets—super AI, generative AI, narrow AI, and chatbots—within the general framework of the public sector. China and the United States are pioneering and leading countries in terms of investment. Although the U.S. stands out in many areas regarding investment, China's integration of artificial intelligence with national strategies and its policies indicate that it may play a more dominant role in the future. There are four main implementation areas of artificial intelligence in the public sector: efficiency and automation, service delivery, data-driven governance, and ethical and regulatory challenges. A review of the literature reveals that the ethical, legal, and social implications of implementing artificial intelligence in the public sector require more careful consideration.

Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work. But to what extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector? Our survey of 938 public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a generative AI system. Public sector professionals were positive about both current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce bureaucratic workload in the future. For example, those working in the NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an enormous potential impact). Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%). While respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%), and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.

GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust. By elucidating the varied risk perceptions across different national contexts, this study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the risks of GenAI within the public sector.

In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses.

Purpose
This paper aims to investigate whether the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) impacts government functionality. The study will analyse GAI’s positive attributes across different dimensions to comprehensively understand its value proposition for public organisations. Furthermore, the paper will outline the strategic interventions required to integrate GAI effectively within the organisational context of government transformation.


Design/methodology/approach
This study measures “government functionality” and “GAI implementation” using abstract macro variables as a second-order formative model. It also includes first-order measurable micro-variables to better understand the concept. In addition, the study introduces “organisational context” as a moderating factor to explain the complex dynamics of integrating GAI to improve government functionality.

Drawing on Weber, we understand the core of these processes to be the replacement of traditions with instrumental rationality, that is, the most calculable and efficient way of achieving any given policy objective. Second, we demonstrate how much of the criticisms, both among the public and in scholarship, directed towards AI systems spring from well-known tensions at the heart of Weberian rationalization. To illustrate this point, we introduce a thought experiment whereby AI systems are used to optimize tax policy to advance a specific normative end: reducing economic inequality. Our analysis shows that building a machine-like tax system that promotes social and economic equality is possible. However, our analysis also highlights that AI-driven policy optimization (i) comes at the exclusion of other competing political values, (ii) overrides citizens’ sense of their (non-instrumental) obligations to each other, and (iii) undermines the notion of humans as self-determining beings. Third, we observe that contemporary scholarship and advocacy directed towards ensuring that AI systems are legal, ethical, and safe build on and reinforce central assumptions that underpin the process of rationalization, including the modern idea that science can sweep away oppressive systems and replace them with a rule of reason that would rescue humans from moral injustices. That is overly optimistic: science can only provide the means – it cannot dictate the ends. Nonetheless, the use of AI in the public sector can also benefit the institutions and processes of liberal democracies. Most importantly, AI-driven policy optimization demands that normative ends are made explicit and formalized, thereby subjecting them to public scrutiny, deliberation, and debate.",Social science computer review,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1177/08944393241235175

SUMMARY ANSWER Generative AI models exhibit the capability to generate high-fidelity human blastocyst images, thereby providing substantial training datasets crucial for the development of robust AI models. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The integration of AI into IVF procedures holds the potential to enhance objectivity and automate embryo selection for transfer. However, the effectiveness of AI is limited by data scarcity and ethical concerns related to patient data privacy. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) have emerged as a promising approach to alleviate data limitations by generating synthetic data that closely approximate real images. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Blastocyst images were included as training data from a public dataset of time-lapse microscopy (TLM) videos (n = 136). A style-based GAN was fine-tuned as the generative model. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS We curated a total of 972 blastocyst images as training data, where frames were captured within the time window of 110–120 h post-insemination at 1-h intervals from TLM videos. We configured the style-based GAN model with data augmentation (AUG) and pretrained weights (Pretrained-T: with translation equivariance; Pretrained-R: with translation and rotation equivariance) to compare their optimization on image synthesis. We then applied quantitative metrics including Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) to assess the quality and fidelity of the generated images. Subsequently, we evaluated qualitative performance by measuring the intelligence behavior of the model through the visual Turing test. To this end, 60 individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise in clinical embryology and IVF evaluated the quality of synthetic embryo images. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE During the training process, we observed consistent improvement of image quality that was measured by FID and KID scores. Pretrained and AUG + Pretrained initiated with remarkably lower FID and KID values compared to both Baseline and AUG + Baseline models. Following 5000 training iterations, the AUG + Pretrained-R model showed the highest performance of the evaluated five configurations with FID and KID scores of 15.2 and 0.004, respectively. Subsequently, we carried out the visual Turing test, such that IVF embryologists, IVF laboratory technicians, and non-experts evaluated the synthetic blastocyst-stage embryo images and obtained similar performance in specificity with marginal differences in accuracy and sensitivity. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION In this study, we primarily focused the training data on blastocyst images as IVF embryos are primarily assessed in blastocyst stage. However, generation of an array of images in different preimplantation stages offers further insights into the development of preimplantation embryos and IVF success. In addition, we resized training images to a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels to moderate the computational costs of training the style-based GAN models. Further research is needed to involve a more extensive and diverse dataset from the formation of the zygote to the blastocyst stage, e.g. video generation, and the use of improved image resolution to facilitate the development of comprehensive AI algorithms and to produce higher-quality images. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Generative AI models hold promising potential in generating high-fidelity human blastocyst images, which allows the development of robust AI models as it can provide sufficient training datasets while safeguarding patient data privacy. Additionally, this may help to produce sufficient embryo imaging training data with different (rare) abnormal features, such as embryonic arrest, tripolar cell division to avoid class imbalances and reach to even datasets. Thus, generative models may offer a compelling opportunity to transform embryo selection procedures and substantially enhance IVF outcomes.

Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential in medical information extraction but carry risks of generating incorrect information. This study aims to develop and validate a retriever-augmented generation (RAG) model that provides accurate medical knowledge about diabetes and diabetic foot care to laypersons with an eighth-grade literacy level. Improving health literacy through patient education is paramount to addressing the problem of limb loss in the diabetic population. In addition to affecting patient well-being through improved outcomes, improved physician well-being is an important outcome of a self-management model for patient health education.


METHODS
We used an RAG architecture and built a question-and-answer artificial intelligence (AI) model to extract knowledge in response to questions pertaining to diabetes and diabetic foot care. We utilized GPT-4 by OpenAI, with Pinecone as a vector database. The NIH National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education served as the basis for our knowledge base. The model's outputs were validated through expert review against established guidelines and literature. Fifty-eight keywords were used to select 295 articles and the model was tested against 175 questions across topics.


RESULTS
The study demonstrated that with appropriate content volume and few-shot learning prompts, the RAG model achieved 98% accuracy, confirming its capability to offer user-friendly and comprehensible medical information.


CONCLUSION
The RAG model represents a promising tool for delivering reliable medical knowledge to the public which can be used for self-education and self-management for diabetes, highlighting the importance of content validation and innovative prompt engineering in AI applications.",Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1177/19322968241253568

Addressing these ethical risks is a complex collective responsibility among designers, developers, risk experts, and public sector managers. Embedding these risks in existing risk management practices is crucial for responsible AI adoption, as emphasized by the legal requirements of the EU AI Act. However, the responsibility for managing these ethical risks is often unclear. Public sector organizations face unique challenges due to the complex, uncertain, and rapidly evolving nature of AI technologies, further complicating the management of ethical risks. This paper explores using the Three Lines of Defense (TLoD) risk management model to understand and address these ethical risks in public sector AI adoption. The TLoD model structures risk management across three lines: operational management, risk oversight and compliance, and internal audit. This framework helps to distribute and integrate the collective responsibility for ethical AI risk management within public sector organizations, emphasizing alignment and collaboration among different actors. Through an exploratory study involving a survey and semi-structured interviews with professionals responsible for AI-related risk management in Dutch public sector organizations, we assess the TLoD model's usefulness in addressing ethical AI risks. The study examines the challenges and opportunities in applying the TLoD model to manage ethical risks and identifies the potential gaps in responsibility and oversight. The findings suggest that while the TLoD model offers a valuable lens for distributing risk management responsibilities, there are limitations in addressing the emergent and complex nature of ethical risks in AI adoption.",Digital Government Research,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1145/3657054.3657063

It argues that although Generative AI is powerful, it has significant limitations and risks that require humans to remain “in the loop” not only to prevent systems from going off the rails, but to capture value. Rather than taking a deterministic view that artificial intelligence (AI) will inevitably destroy jobs, the article suggests that an analysis should start with how firms can strategically deploy these tools to gain an advantage. It asks whether “augmentation” or “simplistic automation” lies ahead. Our objective is to move beyond hype and despair. 2 The existing digital infrastructure has enabled AI to be adopted quickly. However, projections based solely on automating existing tasks fail to capture the complex reorganizations that are likely to happen. Firms in sectors such as professional services, materials, and pharmaceuticals seem to have particular exposure to the use of Generative AI tools. Adaptations will vary across contexts and depend greatly on who controls the decisions about deployment. Maintaining the centrality of humans is likely to prove crucial—in training systems, curating data, and assessing outputs. One question is which business strategies and public policies encourage that engagement and make it possible. Although AI regulation debates matter, promoting social prosperity depends heavily on directly shaping the trajectory of the development and use of AI. This requires influencing the constraints and the incentives that firms face, as well as the strategic mindsets of decision makers. Which groups are engaged in the discussions and debates is of vital importance. The article recommends that, beyond the traditional policy proposals, an independent public-interest consultancy needs to be established in order to design creative business strategies that augment workers in a manner that will support, rather than hinder, social prosperity.

Purpose
This study aims to understand the perceived emotions of human–artificial intelligence (AI) interactions in the private sector. Moreover, this research discusses the transferability of these lessons to the public sector.


Design/methodology/approach
This research analysed the comments posted between June 2022 and June 2023 in the global open Reddit online community. A data mining approach was conducted, including a sentiment analysis technique and a qualitative approach.


Findings
The results show a prevalence of positive emotions. In addition, a pertinent percentage of negative emotions were found, such as hate, anger and frustration, due to human–AI interactions.


Practical implications
The insights from human–AI interactions in the private sector can be transferred to the governmental sector to leverage organisational performance, governmental decision-making, public service delivery and the creation of economic and social value.


Originality/value
Beyond the positive impacts of AI in government strategies, implementing AI can elicit negative emotions in users and potentially negatively impact the brand of private and government organisations. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research bridging the gap by identifying the predominant negative emotions after a human–AI interaction.

Design/methodology/approach: Utilising a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol, the study examines the organisational enablers of AI adoption in public institutions. Comprehensive search queries in the Scopus database identified relevant literature focusing on the intersection of AI technologies and various organisational elements. The analysis was facilitated by NVivo 12, enabling a structured examination of key organisational facets for people, culture, structure, processes, and technology within public institutions. Findings: Previous studies on AI adoption in public institutions identified numerous enablers of AI adoption associated with organisational elements like people/employees, structure, culture, technology, and processes. Several surveys and case studies stress the importance of concentrating on the introduction or transformation of these organisational elements prior to or concurrently with the adoption of AI. Academic contribution to the field: By applying a systematic literature review protocol, the study represents the first holistic and systematic review of specific organisational elements that can serve as enablers of AI adoption in public institutions. Research limitations/implications: This systematic literature review was subject to several limitations. Firstly, the division of AI literature between natural and social sciences, with the former focusing on technical aspects and the latter on broader organisational themes, may have resulted in an incomplete depiction of the intersection of AI and organisational change. Secondly, despite the broad search queries, inherent limitations of keyword-based searches may have excluded some relevant studies. Thirdly, considering the rapid evolution of AI technology, our review may not fully encapsulate the very latest developments in the field as it covers literature published until May 2023. Finally, the interpretation and coding of literature, despite the use of NVivo 12, involved subjective elements that could affect the study’s outcomes. Practical implications: Drawing from experiences in the private sector, public institutions are increasingly adopting AI technologies across various subsectors such as public finance (taxation), research, healthcare, law enforcement, defence, education. This requires a transformation in both hard (structure, processes etc.) and soft aspects (people, organisational culture etc.). Therefore, the enablers identified in the study can serve as guidelines for decision-makers and implementers of AI at all levels of public institutions. Social implications: If adopted effectively and efficiently and used professionally and ethically, the use of AI in public institutions can bring many benefits to society, such as transparency, justice, cost and time efficiency, high quality services, and improved collaboration between different stakeholders in society. Originality/significance/value: Our study makes a distinct contribution by shifting the focus from technological barriers to organisational enablers of AI adoption in public institutions.

Before October 2022, processes of automatization and robotization of manufacturing didn’t have an immediate connection with artificial intelligence in the minds of most people. But mass and sudden infiltration of GenAI into the everyday life of many people around the world caused an immediate reaction from scientists, public figures, politicians, managers and heads of whole sectors of the economy. Thousands of scientific articles on related topics were published in the last two years: everyone at once started talking about fantastic possibilities, and also threats, which this new technology can usher in for our societies. Thus, for public thinking GenAI finally linked automatization with artificial intelligence. 
This paper provides an analysis of problems and prospects, through which scientists are trying to understand different societal processes linked to adoption of AI. For this purpose, the author of this paper analyzed the contents of papers published on this topic on the ResearchGate web portal in 2023, with the choice of the source for representative material motivated by scientific credibility of ResearchGate combined with its wide reach. Ten most popular articles were specifically targeted for final analysis, through which societal trends brought on by AI adoption were described. Although a selective meta-analysis of articles published during the first year after ChatGPT release can’t provide a full understanding of AI potential and possible threats to society, the conclusion can still be reached that a cardinal shift in society’s attitudes towards its own future is required.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) along the acquisition and processing chain. Advanced AI frameworks have been applied in various successive tasks, such as image reconstruction, quantitative parameter map estimation, and image segmentation. However, existing frameworks are often designed to perform tasks independently of each other or are focused on specific models or single datasets, limiting generalization. This work introduces the Advanced Toolbox for Multitask Medical Imaging Consistency (ATOMMIC), a novel open-source toolbox that streamlines AI applications for accelerated MRI reconstruction and analysis. ATOMMIC implements several tasks using deep learning (DL) models and enables MultiTask Learning (MTL) to perform related tasks in an integrated manner, targeting generalization in the MRI domain.


METHODS
We conducted a comprehensive literature review and analyzed 12,479 GitHub repositories to assess the current landscape of AI frameworks for MRI. Subsequently, we demonstrate how ATOMMIC standardizes workflows and improves data interoperability, enabling effective benchmarking of various DL models across MRI tasks and datasets. To showcase ATOMMIC's capabilities, we evaluated twenty-five DL models on eight publicly available datasets, focusing on accelerated MRI reconstruction, segmentation, quantitative parameter map estimation, and joint accelerated MRI reconstruction and segmentation using MTL.


RESULTS
ATOMMIC's high-performance training and testing capabilities, utilizing multiple GPUs and mixed precision support, enable efficient benchmarking of multiple models across various tasks. The framework's modular architecture implements each task through a collection of data loaders, models, loss functions, evaluation metrics, and pre-processing transformations, facilitating seamless integration of new tasks, datasets, and models. Our findings demonstrate that ATOMMIC supports MTL for multiple MRI tasks with harmonized complex-valued and real-valued data support while maintaining active development and documentation. Task-specific evaluations demonstrate that physics-based models outperform other approaches in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions. These high-quality reconstruction models also show superior accuracy in estimating quantitative parameter maps. Furthermore, when combining high-performing reconstruction models with robust segmentation networks through MTL, performance is improved in both tasks.


CONCLUSIONS
ATOMMIC advances MRI reconstruction and analysis by leveraging MTL and ensuring consistency across tasks, models, and datasets. This comprehensive framework serves as a versatile platform for researchers to use existing AI methods and develop new approaches in medical imaging.",Comput.

This study explores the underexplored domain of AI’s role in evaluating prognosis and long-term outcomes in depressive disorders, offering insights into how AI large language models (LLMs) compare with human perspectives. Methods Using case vignettes, we conducted a comparative analysis involving different LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude and Bard), mental health professionals (general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and mental health nurses), and the general public that reported previously. We evaluate the LLMs ability to generate prognosis, anticipated outcomes with and without professional intervention, and envisioned long-term positive and negative consequences for individuals with depression. Results In most of the examined cases, the four LLMs consistently identified depression as the primary diagnosis and recommended a combined treatment of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. ChatGPT-3.5 exhibited a significantly pessimistic prognosis distinct from other LLMs, professionals and the public. ChatGPT-4, Claude and Bard aligned closely with mental health professionals and the general public perspectives, all of whom anticipated no improvement or worsening without professional help. Regarding long-term outcomes, ChatGPT 3.5, Claude and Bard consistently projected significantly fewer negative long-term consequences of treatment than ChatGPT-4. Conclusions This study underscores the potential of AI to complement the expertise of mental health professionals and promote a collaborative paradigm in mental healthcare. The observation that three of the four LLMs closely mirrored the anticipations of mental health experts in scenarios involving treatment underscores the technology’s prospective value in offering professional clinical forecasts.

These sceneries cover a wide range of settings, including as public locations, medical institutions, virtual meeting rooms, and more. Our approach makes use of generator and discriminator blocks as part of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which is further enhanced by several attention layers to generate scenes from test descriptions. The output of the proposed approach ensures that scene creation regarding safety precautions like mask wearing, social distance, and sanitization procedures are included in generated output.",International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1109/SACI60582.2024.10619874

 The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to the wider public could have a huge impact on EFL learning and teaching. Researchers have voiced concerns that learners might lean too much on technology. Previous studies have investigated the use of AI tools in L2 writing with various populations and found that it was difficult for teachers to detect use of AI and that teachers mainly relied on linguistic strategies to detect AI-generated texts. This paper reports on a qualitative study that investigated whether novice English teachers were able to detect AI-generated writing and which strategies they used to do this. The results show that some novice teachers are quite good at detecting AI-generated texts, while others proved to have more difficulties. The teachers used both linguistic and content-related strategies to detect AI-generated writing. The results point towards the value of including this topic in teaching methodology courses in (initial) teacher training programmes.",ELT Journal,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.1093/elt/ccae031

Nevertheless, AI is already an integral part of our digital daily lives, as we navigate through social networks, use our GPS, or consult recommendations on e-commerce websites. Due to its pervasive influence across all sectors of our societies, AI is gradually becoming a pivotal subject in terms of regulation, societal direction, and legislation. As early as 2021, UNESCO published a report presenting avenues for ethical considerations in AI. In June 2023, the European Union also established a regulatory framework outlining requirements and obligations for AI usage. As a digital manifestation and given the ""new ways in which its use influences human thinking, interaction and decision-making and affects education, human, social and natural sciences, culture, and communication and information"" (UNESCO. General Conference, 41st, 2021), public libraries have a role to play in enabling residents within their communities to grasp this technology. Their role is all the more significant as AI generates concerns and distrust (Gillath et al., 2021) among populations when ""libraries also continue to enjoy a high level of trust and appreciation in most of their communities"" (Arlitsch \& Newell, 2017). Understanding AI thus constitutes a new cornerstone for accessing the necessary information to advance sustainable development, as outlined in the Lyon Declaration (2014). Moreover, comprehension of AI aligns with the ethical concerns articulated by UNESCO in terms of explainability and transparency and aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. These goals include quality education (4), industry, innovation and infrastructure (9), reduced inequalities (10), sustainable cities and communities (11), as well as responsible consumption and production (12). The role of public libraries in advancing the goals of the 2030 Agenda is beyond dispute (IFLA, 2016), and various digital literacies are already integral to their actions. As AI is predominantly developed by global economic giants and permeates all of our practices, ""Shouldn’t [libraries] be the bastions of information literacy and information privacy in an AI world?"" (Cox et al., 2018). Thus, to what extent can public libraries take on this subject to promote and offer relevant literacy? For this study, we will conduct a cross-analysis among three European countries—Spain, France, and Italy—to provide insights into the diverse ways in which AI influences professional practices. Through a literature review and semi-structured interviews, the objective is to delineate the challenges of Artificial Intelligence within the framework of the Agenda 2030 program. Subsequently, we will delve into the specificity of AI Literacy in comparison to Information Literacy, a practice already adopted by libraries. Finally, we will analyze the current and prospective role of AI in libraries to propose avenues for implementing concrete actions.",Canadian journal of information and library science,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.5206/cjils-rcsib.v47i2.17699

However, the large-scale development and widespread adoption of AI have been hindered by the model-centric mindset that only focuses on improving the code/architecture of AI models (e.g., tweaking the network architecture, shrinking model size, tuning hyper-parameters, etc.). Generally, AI encompasses a model (or code) that solves a given problem by extracting salient features from underlying data. However, when the AI model yields a low performance, developers iteratively improve the code/algorithm without paying due attention to other aspects such as data. This model-centric AI (MC-AI) approach is limited to only those few businesses/applications (language models, text analysis, etc.) where big data readily exists, and it cannot offer a feasible solution when good data are not available. However, in many real-world cases, giant datasets either do not exist or cannot be curated. Therefore, the AI community is searching for appropriate solutions to compensate for the lack of giant datasets without compromising model performance. In this context, we need a data-centric AI (DC-AI) approach in order to solve the problems faced by the conventional MC-AI approach, and to enhance the applicability of AI technology to domains where data are limited. From this perspective, we analyze and compare MC-AI and DC-AI, and highlight their working mechanisms. Then, we describe the crucial problems (social, performance, drift, affordance, etc.) of the conventional MC-AI approach, and identify opportunities to solve those crucial problems with DC-AI. We also provide details concerning the development of the DC-AI approach, and discuss many techniques that are vital in bringing DC-AI from theory to practice. Finally, we highlight enabling technologies that can contribute to realizing DC-AI, and discuss various noteworthy use cases where DC-AI is more suitable than MC-AI. Through this analysis, we intend to open up a new direction in AI technology to solve global problems (e.g., climate change, supply chain disruption) that are threatening human well-being around the globe.",Electronics,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.3390/electronics13112156

It focuses on the Palestinian Cellular Communications Sector in Gaza Strip, providing insights into the citizen-AI relationship dynamics. The research contributes to enhancing comprehension of AI technology from clients’ perspective.


Design/methodology/approach
To test the hypotheses, a questionnaire was used in an empirical study to collect primary data. In total, 347 Palestinian citizens responded to the survey.


Findings
The findings of this paper reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risks, social influence, user experience and privacy and security concerns significantly influence citizen intention toward AI adoption. Furthermore, government regulations as a moderating variable strengthen the impact of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risks, social influence, user experience and privacy and security concerns on citizen intention toward AI acceptance and adoption. Thus, further research should explore specific domains and cultural contexts to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping acceptance and adoption.


Research limitations/implications
The findings of the study should be understood in the context of their limitations. First, the study ignored cultural or domain-specific subtleties in favor of generic characteristics, which calls for more research in these particular circumstances. Second, relying on self-reported data might result in biases and limitations due to subjectivity in reporting, indicating the necessity for alternate data gathering methods and approaches in future research.


Practical implications
Policymakers, developers and organizations working to promote the acceptability and implementation of AI applications should consider the practical implications of this study’s results. To secure the long-term use of AI technologies in a responsible and user-centric way, policymakers should give priority to public education and awareness, user-centered design and ethical AI development techniques. They should also stimulate partnerships and create monitoring systems.


Originality/value
This paper investigates the originality of factors that influence citizen intention toward AI acceptance and adoption. It uniquely examines the moderating role of government regulations in shaping this intention. By addressing this novel aspect, the paper contributes to advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding citizen intentions toward AI applications.

Recently, the scope of public sector economics has expanded beyond budgetary components in parallel with the development of public finance. While the budget reached the economic division form of budget items based on program and performance theories, Budget monitoring, and financial risk management are currently challenging, particularly in the face of monetary policy uncertainty. Financial institutions are crucially concerned with the stability of public finance in low-income countries (LICs) as it contributes to improved investor confidence and fiscal decision-making. Hence, economists investigated uncertainty shocks and contributed to managing financial risks with global and energy uncertainty indices. Furthermore, the maturity of digital transformation and artificial intelligence financial applications catalyzed scholars to examine its contributions in the fiscal distress prediction field. Hence, this research aims to integrate artificial intelligence into financial performance analysis to bridge the gap in budget forecasting. The study was aimed at proposing an Economics Division Uncertainty approach (EDUA), which combined (ARIMA) and (LSTM) models for time series analysis of Nuclear Material Authority expenditures over the previous five years divided into quarterly periods, to achieve efficiency in spending. The (ARIMA) model’s (ADF) results showed that uncertainty indicators are highly significant. The best (p-value) in the first and second differences in (ARIMA) models is (0.0001) for petroleum items, (0.0001) for solar price rates, (0.001) for the US exchange rate, and (0.003) for electricity price rates, when compared to (EDU_LSTM). Both models have similar accuracy rates, with the best being (EDU_ARIMA) (solar price 97%, USD exchange rate 84%).

Extensive research has examined how algorithms affect communication processes, focusing on their influence on news organizations, journalistic practices, public-media dynamics, media literacy, and combating disinformation and filter bubbles.
An emergent strand of research defines and measures the multidimensional concept of algorithmic literacy. However limited research exists on the intersection of algorithmic literacy and journalism. This gap is particularly concerning given the pivotal role of journalism in shaping public discourse, informing citizens, upholding democratic values and contrasting disinformation. Understanding how journalists perceive and engage with algorithms is essential, as these technologies significantly influence their professional tasks, including content production and distribution.
In Portugal, where newcomer journalists work in precarious conditions and digital media transformation is rapidly evolving, understanding how journalists interact with and perceive algorithms is vital. Our study, through a multi-phased approach, aims to fill this gap questioning how can algorithmic literacy, encompassing cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural dimensions, be effectively assessed among professional journalists?
The exploratory results present a validated methodological tool, instrument based on a multi-dimensional analytical framework and specifically designed to measure algorithmic literacy levels and to assess journalists’ experiences. Critical discussion addresses the methodological procedures and preliminary findings from the pre-test, offering insights into Portuguese journalists' understanding, perceptions, and competencies regarding algorithmic systems. By shedding light on the cognitive, affective, and behavioural aspects of journalists’ engagement with algorithms, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the algorithmic literacy among journalists, which is essential to sustain the quality of their work and for an effective counteraction against disinformation. It also opens avenues for similar studies in other geographical or professional contexts.",Observatorio (OBS*),2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.15847/obsobs18520242433

Depression and anxiety are two major issues that the world is facing, with close to 41% of adults reporting these symptoms in the United States alone, as of December 2020. It has also been observed that most of the people are not open about it. As a result, it is critical to address this issue on a global scale. Developed countries reportedly have 9 psychiatrists per 100,000 people. One way to mitigate this is the use of chatbots. We propose a transformer-based methodology to build a therapy bot that has been trained on a combination of open-domain conversations from a publicly available dataset and therapist-client conversations from a self-constructed dataset. This end-to-end data-driven model shows quality performance in conversations and adds value by aiding in the case of mental health issues. The proposed architecture is proven to be effective in its usability in the psychological space for both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue. The performance of the proposed system shows loss is 0.29 and perplexity is 1.34, both metrics keeps gradually decreasing and it means an improvement in performance of chatbots system.",International Journal of Advances in Applied Sciences,2024,semantic_scholar,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value',10.11591/ijaas.v13.i1.pp1-12

The objective of this project is to examine the application of a collective AI model using weighted fusion of predicted probabilities from different AI architectures to diagnose various retinal conditions based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). A publicly available Noor dataset, comprising 16,822, images from 554 retinal OCT scans of 441 patients, was used to predict a diverse spectrum of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) stages: normal, drusen, or choroidal neovascularization. These predictions were compared with predictions from ResNet, EfficientNet, and Attention models, respectively, using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matric and receiver operating characteristics curves. Our collective model demonstrated superior accuracy in classifying AMD compared to individual ResNet, EfficientNet, and Attention models, showcasing the effectiveness of using trainable weights in the ensemble fusion process, where these weights dynamically adapt during training rather than being fixed values. Specifically, our ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 91.88%, precision of 92.54%, recall of 92.01%, and F1 score of 92.03%, outperforming individual models. Our model also highlights the refinement process undertaken through a thorough examination of initially misclassified cases, leading to significant improvements in the model’s accuracy rate to 97%.

It argues that the vast knowledge base and perspective-aggregation capabilities of these AI models uniquely position them as potentially superior embodiments of the “community conscience” that juries are meant to represent. By synthesizing diverse viewpoints into nuanced, context-sensitive judgments, AI juries could in theory do justice to the broader values and concerns of society in ways that 12-person human juries often fail to achieve. The article first examines the technical capabilities of state-of-the-art language models like ChatGPT, emphasizing the vast scope and diversity of their training data which spans a huge range of human knowledge and perspectives. It then traces the historical development of the jury system and its essential functions as both the moral conscience of the community and a source of democratic legitimacy for the legal system. Building on this foundation, the article makes the case that AI is poised to fulfill the representative and deliberative roles of juries more effectively than human jurors by virtue of its unparalleled capacity to absorb and synthesize society’s heterogeneous values and viewpoints. However, it also carefully considers the significant risks and challenges associated with AI juries, including issues of algorithmic bias, the opacity of machine reasoning, the potential erosion of public trust, and the philosophical implications of outsourcing moral judgment to artificial intelligence. Ultimately, the article argues that while the use of AI in legal decision-making is likely inevitable, it is crucial that we proactively shape the terms of this integration in ways that uphold the core values of fairness, transparency, and democratic accountability. The jury system has long been celebrated as a bastion of citizen participation in the law – the article concludes by calling for a robust public dialogue on how AI can be harnessed to enhance, rather than erode, this vital civic institution.

The development of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has made it possible to solve a number of issues, including automation, control access, optimization, monitoring, and management. Simultaneously, there are significant issues with the design and development of the process hierarchy, including inadequate training records, centralized architecture, data privacy protection, and overall resource consumption restrictions. The development of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), on the other hand, provides a decentralized infrastructure that allows systems to eliminate centralized data-sharing procedures of smart cities while transferring from network node to network node, and third-party access control solves machine learning issues. To process an ideal data delivery mechanism for the smart cities analytical model, the paper employs Partial Swam Optimization (POS) in conjunction with a secure blockchain distributed consortium network. This work makes three contributions. Firstly, it offers a safe transmission method that combines blockchain and machine learning to optimize the path for reliable data delivery across secure channels. Second, neighborhood encryption sequences are carried out using NuCypher proxy re-encryption-enabled value encryption, a public key cryptographic approach that avoids cypher conversion.

This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values.

The analysis employs Linear Regression and Correlation Coefficients to examine the relationships between ROE, Price-to-Sales Ratio, Market Capitalization, and economic conditions during these periods. The findings reveal that Price-to-Sales Ratio serves as a reliable indicator of a company's market capitalization. Furthermore, companies within the same industry exhibit substantial disparities in Market Capitalization, ROE, Price-to-Sales Ratio, Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, and PEG Index due to differing corporate strategies and backgrounds. For instance, in the new energy sector, both BYD and NIO display a negative correlation between market capitalization, while Tesla contradicts this trend. This discrepancy is attributed to internal factors such as asset composition, liabilities, and shareholder structure, which significantly influence a company's financial performance. The Market Capitalization of these new energy companies is predicted to rise due to global interest in AI technology, with technology companies being at the forefront of AI development. In the technology sector, companies like Google have solidified their positions by advancing AI concepts. New entrants, like Apple, combining Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, are gaining consumer support, indicating potential Market Cap. growth. The fashion industry also demonstrates distinctive strategies, with companies like NIKE, Adidas, and Anta focusing on sustainability and carbon neutrality.

CO, NO, C6H6, etc., are the major air pollutants. The focus of air pollutants in ambient air is controlled by the climatological parameters including wind direction, atmospheric speed of wind, temperature, and humidity. Air pollution prediction is a critical sector where machine learning (ML) technique plays a major role. Its main purpose is to tackle and understand the damaging effects of air pollutants on the environment and human health. By using a range of ML techniques such as neural networks, regression, and decision trees, we could analyze historical data on air quality alongside geographical and meteorological factors. This allows us to design model that could detect patterns and predict pollution levels. By taking proactive measures such as providing timely alerts to the public, adjusting controls on emissions, and, implementing strategies to reduce pollution, we can work towards creating healthier and cleaner environments. Embracing the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in air pollution prediction empowers us to protect the well-being of our communities and make informed decisions. Therefore, this study develops an Improved Sine Trigonometric Single Valued Neutrosophic Information based Air Pollution Prediction (ISTSVNI-APP) approach. The major objective of the ISTSVNI-APP technique is to exploit AI concepts with neutrosophic sets (NS) models for the forecasting of air pollution. To do so, the ISTSVNI-APP technique makes use of min-max normalization as the initial preprocessing step. For predicting air pollution, the ISTSVNI-APP technique uses STSVNI approach. To improve the performance of the ISTSVNI-APP technique, modified crow search algorithm (MCSA) is used for the parameter tuning of the STSVNI system.

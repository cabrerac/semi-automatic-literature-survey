  research issues, state-of-the-art, and future directions","Metaverse is an evolving orchestrator of the next-generation Internet
architecture that produces an immersive and self-adapting virtual world in
which humans perform activities similar to those in the real world, such as
playing sports, doing work, and socializing. It is becoming a reality and is
driven by ever-evolving advanced technologies such as extended reality,
artificial intelligence, and blockchain. In this context, Metaverse will play
an essential role in developing smart cities, which becomes more evident in the
post COVID 19 pandemic metropolitan setting. However, the new paradigm imposes
new challenges, such as developing novel privacy and security threats that can
emerge in the digital Metaverse ecosystem. Moreover, it requires the
convergence of several media types with the capability to quickly process
massive amounts of data to keep the residents safe and well-informed, which can
raise issues related to scalability and interoperability. In light of this,
this research study aims to review the literature on the state of the art of
integrating the Metaverse architecture concepts in smart cities. First, this
paper presents the theoretical architecture of Metaverse and discusses
international companies interest in this emerging technology. It also examines
the notion of Metaverse relevant to virtual reality, identifies the prevalent
threats, and determines the importance of communication infrastructure in
information gathering for efficient Metaverse operation. Next, the notion of
blockchain technologies is discussed regarding privacy preservation and how it
can provide tamper-proof content sharing among Metaverse users. Finally, the
application of distributed Metaverse for social good is highlighted.",arxiv,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

INTRODUCTION Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining more and more popularity as a research tool in the field of HumanRobot Interaction (HRI) [1][2][3][4]. VR has been used to test teleoperation and collect demonstration data to train machine learning algorithms, which showcased the effectiveness of learning visuomotor skills using data collected by consumer-grade devices [1]. VR teleoperation systems were proposed to crowdsource robotic demonstrations at scale [2]. A VR simulation framework was also proposed to replace the physical robot, as VR can enable high level abstraction in embodiment and multimodal interaction [3]. VR has also been used as a rapid prototyping tool to design in-vehicle interactions and interfaces for self-driving cars, which showed the evocation to genuine responses from test participants [4]. Compared to other HRI experiment methods, VR as an emerging interactive media provides unique advantages. VR HRI has the potential of having higher immersion and fidelity than picture based HRI, video-based HRI and simulated HRI. In situations where the perception of the robot is challenging, compared to on-screen viewing, VR display showed significant improvement on collaborative tasks [5]. When comparing VR HRI to the physical, realworld interaction (Live HRI), there is a trade-off between the two. VR experiences still cannot replace physical experiences due to system limitation, and limited interaction modalities etc. [6]. For example, system limitations such as limited field of view and low display resolution could reduce immersion and presence of the VR experience, resulting in different behaviors from Live experiments. Limited interaction modalities, such as the absence of touch, means that the participant could not feel the robot or even go through the robot, which could potentially break the entire interaction. Figure 1: Photograph of the Live experiment setting However, with the help of the distribution of consumer-grade VR devices and online crowdsourcing platforms, VR HRI has the potential to gain massive data for training robotic behavior and studying HRI related issues. Data collection through VR can also reduce noise and improve the data quality [1], which help to ease data processing and algorithm training. Furthermore, VR HRI experiments can test concepts and interactions without physical robots, making it more resource efficient and less expensive than Live HRI. Less hardware also means that the experiment will be less cumbersome to set up, easier to be reproduced and to ensure experiment quality. In this study, HRI Proxemics (the preferred personal space between a human and a robot) was compared to give a better justification and more basic understanding of the relationship between Live and VR. Proxemics preferences rely on lower level intuition [7], therefore, reflect the differences in the perceptions between Live and VR better. Compared to other HRI subject such as conversational (audio) or gaze behavior (visual), which are more modality dependent, proxemics can give a comprehensive understanding of the human responses. In addition, variations of modalities in VR can greatly influence human perception. For example, a higher visual familiarity of the physical environment in VR can decrease the effect of distance distortion [8]. Auditory inputs play another important role in VR, the addition of spatial sound can increase the sense of presence in VR and provide sound localization [9]. Thus, this work also compares VR settings with variance in modalities to evaluate the impacts of visual familiarity and spatial sound on VR HRI experiments. A 2 x 3 mixed design experiment was conducted to evaluate the differences between Live and VR HRI, as well as the influence of visual familiarity and spatial sound in VR. For the Live HRI, the pepper robot from Softbank Robotics was used (Figure 1). In the VR HRI, a 3D model of the same robot was used. To measure visual familiarity, the VR scene was created in Blender based on a 3D scan of the physical lab. The spatial sound was created by enabling the movement of the physical robot, due to the difficulties of engineering spatial sound. The interaction was implemented in Unity. As an objective measurement for proxemics preference, the minimum comfort distance (MCD) was measured. In addition, for the psychological perception of the experience, the feeling of presence was measured with the SUS questionnaire. For the perception of the robot, two relevant factors, competence and discomfort was measured with the ROSAS questionnaire.",oceanology,1,unknown

Advances in simulation have led to the burgeoning of various technologies. In recent years, one such technological advancement has been Augmented Reality (AR). Augmented Reality simulations have been implemented in healthcare on various fronts with the help of a plethora of devices including cellphones, tablets, and wearable AR headsets. AR headsets offer the most immersive experience of the AR simulation as they are head-mounted and offer a stereoscopic view of the superimposed 3D models through the attached goggles overlaid on real-world surfaces. To this effect, it is important to understand the performance capabilities of the AR headsets based on workload. In this paper, our objective is to compare the performances of two prominent AR headsets of today, the Microsoft Hololens and the Magic Leap One. We use surgical AR software that allows the surgeons to show internal structures, such as the rib cage, to assist in the surgery as a reference application to obtain performance numbers for those AR devices. Based on our research, there are no performance measurements and recommendations available for these types of devices in general yet. Introduction In an attempt to measure the feasibility and effectiveness of using AR in surgery and nursing education, we developed an application titled ARiSE (Augmented Reality in Surgery and Education) [39]. We incorporated two facets of this application, one to be used during surgery in the Operating Room (OR), and another to assist in the education of nursing students. Surgeons would use this application in the OR during rib-plating surgery and be able to visualize an accurate model of the patient’s rib cage derived from computerized tomography (CT) scans outside their body. The nursing education application would be used by nursing students during the training of fundamental cardiopulmonary physical assessment skills. The students will be able to visualize stock models of various human organs overlaid on manikins along with visual guides to correct auscultation assessment. The aforementioned applications were developed and deployed into the first generation Microsoft Hololens and Magic Leap One AR headsets for practical use. While the application was deployed successfully and demonstrated accurate usability in both devices, our objective in this paper was to measure and compare the performances between the two AR headsets to derive recommendations for when to use which of these devices. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. Direct comparison of head-mounted augmented reality devices from the major brands, namely Microsoft and Magic Leap. 2. Expert evaluation based on real-world application tested with the help of domain specialists. 3. Recommendations for head-mounted Augmented Reality devices. Related Work In this section, we discuss some of the other works that relate to our project and use augmented reality techniques and devices. The related work is split into separated subsections with AR being the common theme applied to different medical areas. Augmented Reality in Mobile Devices for Medical Learning Required clinical content cannot always be imparted in live settings due to various restrictions. Educators have instead started using simulation to enhance clinical education. AR simulations have been used to assist the teaching of emergency situations, procedural training, and anatomy [35]. One such AR simulation is described by Von Jan et al. [1] in their paper. The researchers present an application that may be implemented on cellphones and tablet devices that present life-like scenarios which are overlaid on real-world objects. The trainee would visualize these scenarios through their mobile or tablet devices. This application is called mARble, and the researchers report their findings that indicate that AR enhances learning in medical education settings, specifically for subjects that are visually oriented. Augmented Reality Used in Education In their paper, Steve Chi-Yin Yuen et al. [13] have implemented AR in education and training and evaluated its efficiency. The researchers discuss the applications of AR in various fields including architecture, advertising, entertainment, medicine, gaming, books, travel, and the military. With respect to medical education, their results show AR enhancing surgical procedures and aiding clinical procedures by enhancing efficiency, reducing cost, and improving safety. The researchers also state that AR ahs the potential to invent new clinical and surgical procedures. AR has been integrated with existing medical equipment by Fischer et al. in their research [17]. There has also been research that claims AR to have the potential to make surgery minimally invasive [13] and also to enhance the learning experience in educational settings [29]. Chien et al. have used AR to assist in teaching students the anatomy of a 3D skull [16]. Researchers have also demonstrated that AR may enhance the teaching of human anatomy [19]. AR in Nursing Education Wuller et. al. have reviewed existing AR research to assist nursing education [30]. Foronda et. al. have described 3 types of AR applications used to supplement nursing education [6]. Researchers use the Microsoft Hololens to overlay muscles and bones of the human anatomy on manikins. Rahn et. al., overlay 3D models of human organs in real-time on students using iPads[31]. AR was also used with the help of iPads by Abersold et. al. in their study to assist in the training of the placement of the nasogastric tube(NGT) [32]. Ferguson et. al. have claimed game-based AR applications as having the potential to enhance nursing education [33]. This is also supported by Garrett et. al. who demonstrate improved nursing and clinical skills acquisition in students who participated in AR training scenarios [34]. Simulating Surgeries Scott Delp et al. have reviewed the shortcomings of educating medical personnel in providing appropriate emergency care [2]. In their research Samset et al. [14] developed AR tools for minimal invasive therapies (MIT). Scenarios presented by them include liver surgery, liver tumors, and cardiac surgery. With the help of AR the researchers superimpose real-world objects with 3D models obtained from CT scans. Results demonstrated improved surgical procedures and hence the potential of AR to improve healthcare in terms of utility, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Other research has also been conducted with regards to using AR during surgery. Kawamata et al. describe an AR application in their research that assists in the surgery of pituitary tumors [18]. Their results demonstrated this type of AR navigation allowing surgeons to perform accurate and safe endoscopic operations on these tumors. Memory Retention While Using AR Using Steady State Topography (SST) brain imaging to examine the brain activity of people who participated in AR and non-AR tasks, Heather Andrew et. al. [12] found that the visual attention is almost double when performing AR tasks when compared to non-AR tasks. The author also found that what is stored in memory is 70% higher for AR experiences [12]. Other studies show that the long-term memory of the learner can be enhanced by using multiple media interactions in the learning process [11]. Adedukon-Shittu et. al. have also demonstrated the effectiveness of AR technology with regards to enhancing memory retention and performance [23]. Other studies have also demonstrated the enhanced knowledge acquisition and retention of adequate memory when using AR as a supplemental tool in the education process [24]. Feasibility of Using AR to Train Resuscitation Steve Balian et al. [8] introduced a method of testing the feasibility of using augmented reality to educate healthcare providers about administration of Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Using the Microsoft Hololens to provide users with audio and visual feedback, the blood flow in the human body was superimposed in real time onto a manikin. The study deployed 51 volunteers for this study. The volunteering health care providers were asked to perform CPR using only the Hololens for two minutes. The chest compression parameters were then recorded for this test. The participants generally responded positively to the system. The approach was perceived to be realistic and the AR was considered a helpful tool for training in medical education. Among the volunteers, 94% stated that they would be willing to use this application for CPR training in the future. The further support the notion of AR’s usefulness in education, Balien et al. successfully demonstrated another augmented reality tool that proved to be valuable for existing education approaches in medical training[16]. Menon et al. [37] developed an augmented reality application to improve the training of nursing students that showed a measurable improvement in student outcomes. Time and again augmented reality has proven to be advantageous when integrated into education in terms of novelty, memory retention, and knowledge gained [14] [12] [23] [24] . AR Triage Training for Multi-Casualty Scenarios The order in which patients are treated can have a detrimental effect on the survival rate of a group of patients. Hence, triage, i.e. selecting the most critical patients based on their chance of survival is crucial. John Hendricks et al. [4] devised a virtual reality simulation that assists medical personnel in their training and military field medics in making appropriate decisions in triage training environments. Their model deploys a scene in which users encounter a virtual patient with multiple injury scenarios. The virtual patients can vary with respect to their injuries as well physiological conditions and these conditions can evolve with timebased on their injuries. The injuries are visually supported by animations, such as bleeding and seizures. Augmented rea",oceanology,4,unknown

Such technology has reached the maturity to be translated into commercial products, and published works on HMDs provide glimpses of how AR will disrupt the surgical field, allowing for an ergonomic, intuitive, and 3-dimensional fruition of preoperative and intraoperative information. Nowadays several commercial HMDs, such as Microsoft HoloLens, Meta or Magic Leap, integrate tracking and registration technology, and the deployment of software development kits has reduced technical complexity of custom application development, allowing for a wide range of users to easily create AR applications and attracting researchers to explore their potentialities for the implementation of surgical navigators. The above-mentioned HMDs are designed following an optical see-through (OST) approach, which augments the natural view through the projection of virtual reality information on semitransparent displays in front of the user’s eyes. The OST approach fits well in the surgical domain as it offers an instantaneous full-resolution view of the real world, allowing the natural synchronization of visual and proprioceptive information, and a complete situation awareness. Ongoing research is aimed at the goal of providing a device “conceived as a transparent interface between the user and the environment, a personal and mobile window that fully integrates real and virtual information.”1 Commercial companies are rapidly improving HMD ergonomic aspects, for example, HoloLens 2 features an improved field of view (52° diagonal), which includes eye tracking, and offers more comfortable wearability. However, maximizing surgical accuracy remains a challenge for manufacturers and researchers. Together with ergonomics, the achievement of precision objectives must be addressed to develop a visor suitable for guiding surgical operations, not to mention compliance with medical device regulations. An increasing number of research studies propose the use of commercial HMDs to guide surgical interventions.2 To the best of our knowledge, these works are principally focused on the need to strengthen virtual/real patient registration (eg, use of an external localization system),3 improve virtual content stability,4 and solve calibration issues, and they underestimate the contribution of perceptual issues to the user accuracy. One of the largest obstacles to obtain a perceptually correct augmentation is the inability to render proper focus cues in HMDs; indeed, the majority of systems offers the AR content at a fixed focal distance, failing to stimulate natural eye accommodation and retinal blur effects.5 Our recent work2 suggests to avoid the use of existing HMD-OST, which are not specifically designed for performing tasks in peripersonal space (<1 m), to guide manual tasks requiring a high level of precision, since perceptual issues, particularly “focal rivalry” (ie, inability to see simultaneously in focus the virtual and real content), can affect user performance.5 Most commercial systems (HoloLens, Lumus, Meta, Ora2) indeed have a fixed focal plane at 2 m or more (often infinite).

The enhancement may consist of virtual artifacts to be fitted into the environment or a display of non-geometric information about existing real objects. Mobile AR (MAR) systems implement this interaction paradigm in an environment in which the user moves, possibly over wide areas (Feiner, MacIntyre, Hoellerer, & Webster, 1997). This is in contrast to non-mobile AR systems that are utilized in limited spaces such as a computer-aided surgery or by a technician’s aid in a repair shop. There are a number of challenges to implementing successful AR systems. These include a proper calibration of the optical properties of cameras and display systems (Tuceryan et al., 1995; Tuceryan, Genc, & Navab, 2002), and an accurate registration of threedimensional objects with their physical counterparts and environments (Breen, Whitaker, Rose, & Tuceryan, 1996; Whitaker, Crampton, Breen, Tuceryan, & Rose, 1995). In particular, as the observer (or an object of interest) moves over time, the 3D graphics need to be properly updated so that the realism of the resulting scene and/or alignment of necessary objects and graphics are maintained. Furthermore, this has to be done in real time and with high accuracy. The technology that allows this real-time update of the graphics as users and objects move is a tracking system that measures the position and orientation of the tracked objects (Koller et al., 1997). The ability to track objects, therefore, is one of the big challenges in MAR systems. This article describes a software framework for realizing such a distributed tracking environment by discovering independently deployed, possibly heterogeneous trackers and fusing the data from them while roaming over a wide area. In addition to the MAR domain, this kind of a tracking capability would also be useful in other domains such as robotics and locationaware applications. The novelty of this research lies in the amalgamation of the theoretical principles from the domains of AR/VR, data fusion, and the distributed software systems to create a sensor-based, wide-area tracking environment.

To achieve a better understanding of the real-world performance of 802.11 DCF networks, we have constructed an emulation platform and a prototype testbed for performance evaluation. The design and implementation of these two platforms are discussed in this paper. The key DCF parameters, i.e., the initial contention window size ($CW_{min}$) and the maximum contention window size ($CW_{max}$), are tuneable so that we are able to study the impact of these DCF parameters on the network performance. These experiment results are compared against with a recently proposed unified analytical framework to examine the model assumptions and system performance bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that by adapting the values of $CW_{min}$ based on WiFi traffic load, the maximal network throughput can be achieved, and the optimal value of $CW_{min}$ varies when the network size changes. As a reality check, the emerging software defined WiFi network architecture can be optimized for performance enhancement guided by this unified performance model.",oceanology,9,unknown

Augmented reality head-mounted displays, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, make it possible to view 3-D data overlaid on the real world. This allows a user to view and interact with the data in ways similar to how they would interact with a physical 3-D object, such as moving, rotating, or walking around it. A type of 3-D data that is particularly useful for military applications is geo-specific 3-D terrain data, and the visualization of this data is critical for training, mission planning, intelligence, and improved situational awareness. Advances in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), photogrammetry software, and rendering hardware have drastically reduced the technological and financial obstacles in collecting aerial imagery and in generating 3-D terrain maps from that imagery. Because of this, there is an increased need to develop new tools for the exploitation of 3-D data. We will demonstrate how the HoloLens can be used as a tool for visualizing 3-D terrain data. We will describe: 1) how UAScollected imagery is used to create 3-D terrain maps, 2) how those maps are deployed to the HoloLens, 3) how a user can view and manipulate the maps, and 4) how multiple users can view the same virtual 3-D object at the same time.",oceanology,10,unknown

We propose an automated and systematic approach for testing and rectify networks called “Automatic evaluates Package Generation” (ATPG). ATPG reads router configurations and generates a device-independent model. The model is used to generate a minimum set of test packets to minimally exerting every link in the network or maximally exerting every rule in the network. Test packets are sent periodically, and detected failures trigger a separate mechanism to localize the revoke. ATPG can detect both functional and renderings problems. ATPG complements but goes beyond earlier work in static checking for which cannot detect liveness or performance faults or fault localization which only localize revoke given liveness results. We describe our prototype ATPG implementation and results on two real-world data sets: Stanford University’s backbone network and Internet. We find that a small number of test packets suffice to test all rules in these networks. A sending 4000 test packet 10 times per second consumes less than 1% of link capacity. ATPG code and the datasets are publicly available.

It is very often used in the world of computers and their use in different connections. The term networking express the link between two or more computers and their tendency, with the vital purpose of sharing the data stored in the computers, with each other. The networks between the computing tendencies are very public these days due to the launch of assorted hardware and computer software which aid in making the activity much more convenient to build and use. Fig: 1.1Structure of Networking between the different computers The discuss about Figure: 1.1 Structure of Networking between the different computer. Its main process of share the Internet to different things and devices. General Network Techniques When computers communicate on a network, they send out information packets without knowing if anyone is listening. Computers in a network all have an attached to the network and that is called to be attached to a network bus. What one computer sends out will reach the other computer on the local area network. © 2017 IJEDR | Volume 5, Issue 1 | ISSN: 2321-9939 IJEDR1701073 International Journal of Engineering Development and Research (www.ijedr.org) 476 Fig: 1.2 the clear idea about the networking functions The discus about figure: 1.2 clear ideas of network function and different computers to be able to distinguish between each other, every computer have unique ID called MAC-address Media Access Control Address. This address is not only unique on your network but unique for all tendencies that can be aquiline up to a network. The MAC-address is tied to the hardware and has nothing to do with IP-addresses. Since all computers on the network graduate inversion that is sent out from all other computers the MACaddresses is primarily used by the computers to filter out incoming network traffic that is addressed to the scratcher computer. When a computer expostulation with another computer on the network, it sends out both the other computers MAC-address and the MACaddress of its own. In that way the receiving computer will not only realize that this parcel is for me but also, who sent this data packet so a return response can be sent to the sender. Ethernet network as delineate here, all computers hear all network aggregation since they are attached to the same bus. This network structure is called multi-drop. One problem with this network structure is that when you have, let say ten computers on a network and they expostulation attendance and due to that they sends out there data packets randomly, collisions occur when two or more computers sends data at the same time. When that happens data gets imperfect and has to be resent. On a network that is heavy loaded even the resent packets collide with other packets and have to be resent again. In reality this soon takes affect an information problem. If respective computers communicate with each other at high speed they may not be able to utilize more than 25% of the total network information measure since the rest of the bandwidth is used for regressive antecedently corrupted packets. The way to minimize this problem is to use network switches. II.RELATED NETWORK Detecting the occurrence and location of performance anomalies is critical to ensuring the effective operation of network infrastructures. In this paper we present a framework for detecting and apposition performance anomalies based on using an active investigate measurement infrastructure deployed on the periphery of a network. Our framework has three components: an algorithm for detection performance oddball on a path, an algorithm for environs which paths to probe at a given time in order to detect performance anomalies where a path is defined as the set of links between two sampling nodes, and an algorithm for designation the links that are causing an identified anomaly on a path The path selection algorithm is designed to enable a interchange between insure that all links in a network are of times monitored to detect performance anomalies, while minimizing probing overhead.[1] This paper, we develop failure-resilient techniques for monitoring link detain and imbecility in a Service Provider or endeavor IP network. Our two-phased approach attempts to minimize both the monitoring infrastructure costs as well as the additional aggregation due to probe messages. In the first phase, we compute the particular point of a minimal set of monitoring stations such © 2017 IJEDR | Volume 5, Issue 1 | ISSN: 2321-9939 IJEDR1701073 International Journal of Engineering Development and Research (www.ijedr.org) 477 that all network links are covered, even in the bigness of several link reverting. Afterwards, in the second phase, we compute a minimal set of probe messages that are transmitted by the stations to measure link delays and isolate network faults these approximation ratios are provably very close to the best possible bounds for any algorithm. [2]We present a new symbolic execution tool, KLEE, capable of automatically induce tests that wangle high coverage on a diverse set of complex and environmentallyintense programs. We used KLEE to thoroughly check all 89 stand-alone programs in the GNU COREUTILS utility suite, which form the core user-level environment position on millions of UNIX systems, and arguably are the single most heavily tested set of open-source programs in existence. KLEE-generated tests achieve high line coverage on average over 90% per tool. [3] The emergence of Open Flow-capable switches enables exciting new network functionality, at the risk of programming errors that make communication less reliable. The centralized programming model, where a single accountant program manages the network, seems to reduce the likelihood of bugs. However, the system is inherently scattered and asynchronous, with events happening at different switches and end hosts, and inevitable delays affecting communication with the controller. In this paper, we present economic, regular techniques for testing unqualified controller programs. Our NICE tool applies model checking to explore the state space of the entire system the controller, the switches, and the hosts. [4] Network performance tomography, characteristics of the network interior, such as link loss and packet latency, is inferred from unrelated end-to-end measurements. Most work to date is based on employ packet level correlations. However, these methods are often limited in scope-multicast is not widely deployed-or require deployment of additional hardware or software system. Some recent work has been successful in reaching a less detailed goal: identifying the lossiest network links using only unrelated end-toend sampling. In this paper, we abstract the properties of network performance that allow this to be done and exploit them with a quick and simple deduction algorithm that, with high likely, separate the worst performing links.

These smart sensors/actuators are being networked together through: either standards based or industry specific, proprietary, wired networks or newly emerging wireless networking technologies. Presently, at the twoand four-year college level, technicians and technologists in a wide variety of impacted disciplines are not receiving an adequate education about: fundamental sensor theory, basic sensor operation, sensor system deployment planning, appropriate data-transport and networking connectivity schemes, applications software, and impending system maintenance support needs of these increasingly more sophisticated and complex, smart sensor/actuator based systems. This paper will report on the development, organization, and use of a novel interdisciplinary sensor networks laboratory. The heart of the laboratory is a dedicated data-network (SensorNet) that emulates a wide area network or WAN. The SensorNet WAN nodes and other network access points allow for the interconnection of numerous types of industry specific and standard “area networks” typically utilized for the gathering of sensor data and directing other sensor functions, as well as, the associated PC’s and servers used to direct the sensor systems and warehouse the gathered data. This laboratory environment lends itself to real world case-study and problem-based type student-centered learning experiences that can be themselves integrated into established fields of technology that do not normally include this type of activity as part of the field’s traditional educational experience at the undergraduate level. I. Overview Although it is not uncommon for several different technology fields to converge together, it is somewhat unexpected to observe such an amalgamation rapidly triggering other technologic innovations that have widespread potential to change our relationship with the environment and our daily endeavors. However, this is just what is happening today. Only a short time ago, the Internet, the result of a convergence of several technologies, spawned the development of what is commonly known as the “Information Economy.” Today another innovative and important convergence of technologies has recently gained critical mass and recognition by business and industry, government, academia, and professional societies. It is the deployment of intricate systems involving complex sensors with embedded (ambient) intelligence and advanced actuators coupled with modern data-transport and networking technologies and applicationenabling software with data fusion capabilities. This rapidly evolving convergence of technologies, which allows us to implement sensor systems that gather in situ (remote), realtime, statistically relevant information and interpret it in new and novel ways, has already started to transform automation and process control systems. The technology of networked sensor systems has the very genuine potential to significantly impact almost every aspect of human endeavor by increasing system efficiency, reducing energy consumption, permitting the real-time monitoring of the “health” of the nation’s infrastructure and environment, and improving public health and safety. Applications are limitless! P ge 1.77.3 On a global level, the NSF has been calling this “grand convergence,” cyberinfrastructure. One may find many references to this concept, forecasts of potential future applications, reports on inprogress test projects such as HPWREN, NIMS, and ROADnet, and potential research funding opportunities on the NSF’s Web site [1] . However, most of this current, enthusiastic attention and promotion of cyberinfrastructure by the NSF is aimed at senior, graduate-level research institutions. Not surprisingly, most of the NSF’s recent Requests for Proposals (RFPs) in this area have been targeted at basic research about wireless sensor networks and systems and applications of these systems to infrastructure and environmental monitoring and other technology areas. While many applications of networked sensor systems are yet to be even thought of, the reality is that they are being deployed today and will continue to proliferate for many years to come until they eventually become as commonplace as a typical public utility like electricity. This paper describes aspects of an NSF funded CCLI project (DUE 0736888), titled, “The Sensor Networks Education Project” (SNEP) that seeks to develop materials and a model teaching laboratory that will be useful for other faculty and organizations at the twoand even the four-year college level to emulate. This project looks at this evolving convergence on a more practical level and speaks to the lack of engineering technology faculty expertise and teaching materials needed to infuse the newly recognized, exponentially growing knowledge base of networked sensor technology into the curricula and hence into the skill-sets of today’s twoand four-year technical college graduates – the technicians and technologists of tomorrow. This is the community of workers that will most likely deal with the design, deployment, updating, and maintenance of these systems. Today, networks of legacy and newer sophisticated sensors that combine reconfigurable gigascale semiconductor technology with emerging micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology subsystems [2] (i.e. bio-systems/chemical/molecular/photonic) are being designed and deployed in almost every area of technology that impacts human endeavor and commerce (i.e. Aerospace, Agriculture, Automotive, Biomedical, Building Automation, Energy Exploration and Production, Environmental Monitoring, Healthcare, Homeland Security, Industrial Automation, Infrastructure Monitoring, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Military, Pharmaceutical, Telecomm, Transportation, Weather Forecasting, etc). These sensors are being networked together through: either standards based or industry proprietary wired networks or emerging wireless networking technologies. Presently, at the twoand four-year college level, technologists and technicians in a wide variety of impacted disciplines are not receiving an adequate education about: fundamental sensor theory, basic sensor operation, sensor system deployment planning, appropriate data-transport and networking connectivity schemes, applications software, and impending system maintenance support needs of these increasingly more sophisticated sensor based systems. Recently, there has been a great deal of public dialogue about the out-sourcing of American manufacturing jobs and the effect of this reality on the nation’s future. Dealing with an ever increasing base of physical sensor networks in all areas of endeavor will not be something that can be done through a call to a help desk located in a foreign country. The apparent curriculum shortcoming regarding these topics within today’s associate and bachelors degree technology oriented programs is primarily due to the extremely rapid evolution and convergence of several key areas of electronics, computer, and MEMS technology (i.e. embedded processing, smart P ge 1.77.4 sensors/actuators, wired and wireless networking, etc), the lack of appropriate up-to-date educational materials, and a lack of appropriate faculty expertise in this rapidly expanding and remarkably cross-disciplinary field. II. Project Overview Over its two-year life-span, this CCLI Phase I project has as its primary goals the creation and testing of interdisciplinary student-centered learning materials primarily designed for a “field laboratory” type environment, the dissemination of these materials, and the development of faculty expertise in the multi-disciplinary field of networked sensors and modern active-learner teaching techniques. To accomplish these goals the project will: (1) develop and deploy a model, innovative, replicate-able, multi-interdisciplinary, case-study and problem-based oriented, networked, distributed sensor laboratory, (2) develop basic and advanced instructional materials and standard and “hybrid” laboratory activities related to the sensor laboratory that can be utilized for introductory courses in sensor technology or more advanced courses in networked sensor systems for use by both twoand four-year technology programs, (3) develop several prototype multifaceted educational modules that integrate traditional science and math based theory, practical real-world laboratory exercises, and science based, high-resolution, interactive simulation software, applicable to several of the major technology areas employing networked sensor technology (i.e. building automation and infrastructure monitoring and industrial automation), and (4) provide on-going local, regional, and national dissemination of these developed materials and laboratory experiences through hands-on faculty workshops and webbased distribution technologies including the National Science Digital Library (NSDL). In addition, for the duration of the project, continuous on-going professional development in the principles and applications of student-centered and active learner techniques will be provided to the recruited college faculty that will take part in the project. Research has shown that long term professional development programs are more effective than short-term workshops. For this project to be successful, the participating faculty must learn how to effectively integrate content and pedagogy in a way that actively engages students in individual and collaborative problem solving, analysis, synthesis, critical thinking, reasoning, and skillfully applying knowledge in real-w",oceanology,12,unknown

This implies a growing demand of computing resources that severely exploits computational environments in terms of sustainability and reliability of the infrastructure.
 The developments in computing hardware and software, in particular the deployment of world-wide reliable Grid Computing infrastructures, the adoption of innovative computing approaches like the General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) Computing and the High Performance Network environments, stimulate the exploitation of new approaches and methodologies in Computational Sciences. Furthermore the advances made in the World Wide Web, allow the implementation of Web sites from which the simulation of elementary chemical processes at molecular level is performed combining various techniques and computational approaches which are executed on High Throughput Computing (HTC) and/or High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms.
 The ubiquity of information and computing resources has impacted on the researchers? productivity, in a similar way the same technologies impacted everyone?s daily life. The E-science technologies facilitate the exchange of information among researchers, enhance the collaborative work and increase the quality of dissemination of results. Several European initiatives are devoted to facilitate researchers? work and to establish networks among researchers of the various disciplines, enabling some European research groups to reach leading positions in their disciplines. We have got the support of the EU COST (COllaboration in Science and Technology) Initiative in two Actions devoted to the facilitation of adoption of Grid and Distributed Computing technologies in Molecular and Matter Sciences. In particular I participated to the COST D23 Action: Metachem - Metalaboratories for Complex Computational Applications in Chemistry (2000-2005), and I coordinated the Working Group: Simbex: a metalaboratory for the a priori simulation of crossed molecular Beam Experiments. Furthermore I participated to the COST D37 Action: Grid Computing in Chemistry: GRIDCHEM (2006-2009), and I coordinated the Working Group: ELAMS: E-science and Learning Approaches in Molecular Science.
 The outcomes of both COST Actions contributed significantly to establish an active group of Computational Chemistry and Molecular and Matter Science laboratories which adopted the Grid Computing as an innovative computing paradigm for performing massive computational campaigns.
 Since 2004 the researchers of such laboratories joined the Virtual Organization (VO) CompChem established on the EGEE Grid Infrastructure, the largest distributed computing environment ever established worldwide, and coordinated by CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire). I served as VO Manager since the VO was established, under the coordination of Prof. Antonio Lagana, Department of Chemistry, University of Perugia.
 The present thesis covered a long period of research work focused on implementing some e-science instruments to the computational chemistry community, in particular the community of users belonging to the COMPCHEM Virtual Organization active in the EGEE/EGI European Grid Initiative.
 The Thesis describes some tools and approaches the author adopted to provide innovative tools to the Computational Chemistry community based on two main pillars:
1. approaches for running large computational campaigns on Grid Infrastructures 2. adopting virtual reality techniques for making more intuitive the interaction with nanoscale computing approaches and simplifying the definition of the initial conditions of the molecular simulations
 The research work originated 10 research papers, several of them produced as a joint work with European laboratories interested in the implementation of e-science tools for a smart, curious and demanding community like the Computational Chemistry one.
 The author has been able to provide a useful view of the molecular world through the use of virtual reality techniques, combined with the most advanced Web technologies, in particular using the ISO standard X3D for the 3D visualization and interaction with a virtual world. These innovative tools enabled the researchers to set up the environment for carrying out complex molecular simulations (as in the case of the Dl-Poly software package) in a intuitive and visual way. Once defined the species interacting in the considered molecular system, represented in a virtual world, the system produce the input file for the simulation and the Dl-Poly program may be launched, possibly on a Grid infrastructure to take benefit of the powerful available computational resources.
 In chapters 1, 2 and 3 the various steps toward the implementation of an a-priori molecular simulator on the EGEE/EGI Grid, for the COMPCHEM VO users, are reported.
 Molecular Virtual Reality applications are really useful as e-learning support tools for Chemistry students. To this purpose we implemented a Learning Management System based on a semantic web approach, described in chapter 7, and an assessment system, described in chapter 8, which have been used several times to assess the competences of students participating to the Erasmus Mundus Master of Science in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modeling. The system enables the coordinators of the Master to monitor the progresses made by the students an a daily basis.
 The author has shown how it is possible to use virtual reality approaches to describe a chemical experiment at both human and molecular level using a virtual reality approach. To this end a multi-scale virtual reality approach has been adopted to deal with the description of the physical environment,HVR. The main features of the virtual reality representation of the experiments and the potentiality of associating VRML and X3D with Java engine calculator are outlined in chapter 4.
 In chapter 5 an X3D Molecular Virtual Reality environment in which the researcher is able to interact with it by using immersive devices and dynamic gestures is described. By using the gestures the researcher is able to modify the composition of the molecular system by adding or subtracting functions and the molecular properties of the new species are evaluated in real time by invoking a Web Service implementing the simulation environment. This has required the assemblage of an innovative approach coupling the management of immersive devices with Web Services and molecular dynamics packages.
 In chapter 6 the author has presented an X3D Molecular Virtual Reality environment which makes usage of the most recent and powerful HTML and Web technologies. The approach implemented takes into account the modern approaches followed in implementing Social Networking environments and showed how useful these approaches are also in implementing scientific environments.

The social networking showed us how deep may be the impact of the computing and networking facility in the daily life and similarly the computational science, and the computational chemistry in particular, has to reshape the classical approaches and methodologies in order to gain advantage of the modern computing platforms and the powerfulness of the networking, distributed and mobile environments.",oceanology,14,unknown

The sensor is not a pure data source, but an entity (Semantic Sensor Web) with associated metadata and it is a building block of a “worldwide distributed” real time database, to be processed through real-time queries. Important challenges are to achieve interoperability in connectivity and processing capabilities (queries) and to apply “intelligence” and processing capabilities as close as possible to the source of data. This paper presents the extension of a general architecture for data integration in which we add capabilities for processing of complex queries and discuss how they can be adapted to, and used by, an application in the Semantic Sensor Web, presenting a pilot study in environment and health domains. 1 Background and Motivation The rapid development and deployment of sensor technology involves many different types of sensors, both remote and in situ, with such diverse capabilities as range, modality, and manoeuvrability. It is possible today to utilize networks with multiple sensors to detect and identify objects of interest up close or from a great distance. Connected Objects – or the Internet of Things – is expected to be a significant new market and encompass a large variety of technologies and services in different domains. Transport, environmental management, health, agriculture, domestic appliances, building automation, energy efficiency will benefit of real-time reality mining, personal decision support capabilities provided by the growing information shadow (i.e. data traces) of people, goods and objects supplied by the huge data available from the emerging sensor Web [1]. Vertical applications can be developed to connect to and communicate with objects tailored for specific sub domains, service enablement to face fragmented connectivity, device standards, application information protocols etc. and device management. Building extending connectivity, connectivity tailored for object communication – with regards to business model, service level, billing etc, are possible exploitation areas of the Internet Connected Objects. Important challenges are to achieve interoperability in connectivity and processing capabilities (queries, etc.), to distribute “intelligence” and processing capabilities as close as possible to the source of data (the Giordani I., Toscani D., Archetti F. and Cislaghi M..

The sensor is not a pure data source, but an entity (Semantic Sensor Web) with associated domain metadata, capable of autonomous processing and it is a building block of a “worldwide distributed” real time database, to be processed through realtime queries. The vision of the Semantic Sensor Web promises to unify the real and the virtual world by integrating sensor technologies and Semantic Web technologies. Sensors and their data will be formally described and annotated in order to facilitate the common integration, discovery and querying of information. Since this semantic information ultimately needs to be communicated by the sensors themselves, one may wonder whether existing techniques for processing, querying and modeling sensor data are still applicable under this increased load of transmitted data. In the following of this paper we introduce the state of the art in data querying over network of data providers. In Sect. 2 we present the software architecture of a data integration system in which we added complex query processing features. Sect. 3 introduces the case study in which we deployed our system: the study of short term effect of air pollution on health. Sect. 4 presents the detailed implementation of the querying features together with results on real data sets. Finally, Sect 5 presents the conclusions and future work. 1.1 State of the Art This paper stems from the work presented in [12], in which is presented a software system aimed at forecasting the demand of patient admissions on health care structures due to environmental pollution. The target users of this decision sup-port tool are health care managers and public administrators, which need help in resource allocation and policies implementation. The key feature of that system was the algorithmic kernel, to perform time series analysis through Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models (AHMM) [7]. The scenario in which the system has been deployed is the research project LENVIS1, which is aimed to create a network of services for data and information sharing based on heterogeneous and distributed data sources and modeling. One of the innovations brought by LENVIS is the “service oriented business intelligence”, i.e. an approach to Business Intelligence in which the information presented to the user comes from data processing that is performed online, i.e. data are extracted under request of the applications, and on the basis of data availability, i.e. data are exchanged through web services, which does not guarantee response time neither availability. Such a complex environment, in which data sources are distributed over the internet, is common to several problems and has been faced by different approaches. One of them is that of [13], in which “monitoring queries” continuously collect data about spatially-related physical phenomena. An algorithm, called Adaptive Pocket Driven Trajectories, is used to select data collection paths based on the spatial layout of sen1 LENVIS Localised environmental and health information services for all.

E-learning is usually used in distance learning and may be used to replace conventional classroom teaching. Many educational institutions use Internet for collaborative learning in a distributed educational process. It has been known that traditional communications media can be replaced by electronic communication for the whole educational process and in particular, to assess the role of collaborative learning in a distributed education environment. It has been found that a distributed educational process naturally supports collaborative learning environments in which students and tutors interact and provide essential support for students studying at a distance. The tutor’s feedback to students help the learning process and there is indication that tutors are happy to work in the new environment. It is therefore suggested that “blended” online teaching – a combination of the use of the Internet as a medium of instruction and tutors to do face-to-face teaching via a collaborative learning approach – may be implemented to achieve enhanced distance-student performance. INTRODUCTION There is a number of definitions for e-learning. For example, Soekartawi et al. (2002) defined elearning as: ‘... a generic term for all technologically supported learning using an array of teaching and learning tools as phone bridging, audio and videotapes, teleconferencing, satellite transmissions, and the more recognized web-based training or computer aided instruction also commonly referred to as online courses...’. Today, e-learning has become an extremely popular alternative means of delivering educational services worldwide mainly because it is seen as a means of resolving significant educational problems that cannot be solved by conventional means. E-learning is particularly used in open and distance learning (ODL) as it can provide flexible education for those who cannot attend regular schooling particularly because they are unable to leave their work to attend regular conventional classes. Additionally, in an archipelagic country like Indonesia, where the bulk of the population is spread over thousands of islands, educational services are made more accessible through ODL. Most ODL programmes in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, deploy any one or a combination of the following media: print, radio, television, audiocassettes, videocassettes and computers. Generally, the course materials of ODL programmes in the region are largely print-based. It is likely that this will continue for a long time. However, by increasing the use of computers and information and communication technology (ICT), the role of the printed-based course materials will be replaced gradually by e-learning. MOJIT Effectiveness Of Collaborative Learning In Online Teaching* 69 The development of ICT is moving rapidly because of its pertinent role in providing education to the masses. In fact, by effectively deploying ICT, the educational institutions concerned can cope with, and cater to, the expanding student population. In general, it has been observed that the use of ICT in education in Indonesia has resulted in relatively successful outcomes. There have been numerous problems, however, but there is one significant issue that may be cited here because of its implications to future endeavours in education in Indonesia and in the Southeast Asian region as well. This issue has direct influence over the learning process. It is called transactional distance. The physical separation of teacher and student is no longer a problem given the developments in ICT. However, with ICT use, transactional distance can easily result in a misunderstanding and miscomprehension of the concepts to be learned. In fact, it can even lead to the mal-education of people, following a lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. If there is no communication, however, this transactional distance between learner and teacher becomes wider. THE NEW LEARNING PARADIGM In 1995, the International Council on Distance Education (ICDE) conducted what it called an anecdotal, worldwide survey to determine the nature, reality and pace of the shift in the learning paradigm (ICDE, 1996). The survey noted the following clear signs: o A shift from objective knowledge to constructed knowledge. o A shift from an industrial-based to a knowledge-based society. o A shift in education missions from providing instruction to providing learning. o A shift in technologically-mediated procedures of communication and learning. o A shift from “current college and university models to as yet undetermined structures.” Over the last five years, the fifth observation of ICDE has become very clear. The “undetermined structure” at the time of the ICDE survey has come to be known as the virtual learning structure. Experts made similar observations from the ICTsector at about the same time period (Soekartawi et al., 2002). The importance of the virtual campus in the Indonesian context has been reported by Soekartawi (2002, 2002a, 2003) and Haryono & Alatas (2002). According to Garmer & Firestone (1996), due to the development of ICT, the paradigm for learning is shifting away from the traditional notion that ‘‘knowledge” is transferred from teacher to student within the confines of the classroom where the focus of the teaching-learning process before was the teacher; now, it is shifting to the learner. A new understanding of learning places the learner at the centre of the learning process, with the teacher serving an important supporting role in facilitating the process (Garmer & Firestone, 1996). In this new paradigm, successful learning is measured by the individual’s ability to apply appropriate tools and information to solve problems in real life. There is a challenge in this new concept of learning. It is necessary to unlearn old habits and notions of how learning should be structured and to develop new habits of instruction that motivate learners to take greater control over their own education (Garmer & Firestone, 1996). This is what generally known by the “first concern” which should be to understand the learner’s motivations and goals in order that we can expand opportunities for learning. This new paradigm has critical implications for the use of ICT (e-learning) in education, particularly for ODL. For one, it requires that the learner take on more responsibility and autonomy in his learning. This is something that the learner may not be comfortable with or prepared to assume completely at this time. For another, teachers will have to give up control over the learning process and take on a new role similar to that of educational coaches who spend more time on the sidelines MOJIT Effectiveness Of Collaborative Learning In Online Teaching* 70 watching and maybe making plans for a more effective learning environment. The new paradigm has also highlighted an important issue. There is a need for all learners to upgrade their skills, particularly skills to learn on their own. This largely requires an ability to seek, understand and use information, which, in turn, requires the ability to use technology. In today’s world, for example, one must be computer literate to gain access to information and new knowledge. COLLABORATIVE LEARNING One of the critical factors in online learning is the quality issue. Many efforts can be used to meet this issue, among them obtaining feedback evaluation from the student. Further, a crucial aspect of successful distance education is the quality of feedback on student assignments. The electronic assignment handling system pioneered in these trials has now been adopted by the Open University at large and will serve a big number of students. Collaborative learning, therefore, can be used to improve the issue of quality in distance learning. Collaborative learning is an essential ingredient in the recipe to create an ""effective learning environment"" as it provides learners with the opportunity to discuss, argue, negotiate and reflect upon existing beliefs and knowledge. The learner is ""...involved in constructing knowledge through a process of discussion and interaction with learning peers and experts...."" Harasim (in Thomas, 1999, p.51). To facilitate collaboration so that personal knowledge can be constructed, there needs to be a purpose for the collaboration and the purpose needs to be meaningful to the learner. Thus, it is important that an appropriate context is set for the collaborative activity, for example, assigning a ""real world"" task for learners or a problem to which all learners can relate. In addition to setting the context, there needs to be a vehicle through which collaboration can take place. In traditional faceto-face educational settings, collaboration mostly occurs through conversation, that is, individuals interacting with one another via the use of language. Therefore, in terms of creating an effective learning environment, four attributes surface as being paramount: • Providing opportunities to foster personal construction of knowledge • Setting an appropriate context for learning to create the opportunities. • Facilitating collaboration amongst learners. • Using conversation to facilitate collaboration. Petre (1998) argued that while superficially it might appear that distance learning/education is the domain of the distance educator, the aims of educational institutions are similar in ideology; according to Thomas (1999), only the implementations differ. However, what distance educators brings to this arena is the experience of how to interact with students and tutors who are geographically and temporally remote from a campus as well as from one another. The ultimate objective is to diminish and even remove the barriers that remoteness erects. In general, the learning environment in the Open University can be described",oceanology,16,unknown

Indeed, Business Process Management (BPM) has focused on relatively mature operations, with the goal of improving performance through automation. However, in today’s world of customer-centricity and individualized services, the richest source of economic value-creation comes from enterprise-customer contacts beyond transactions. Consequently, process has recently moved out of its traditional court and is becoming prevalent in less traditional competences such as marketing operations, customer-relationship management, campaign creation and monitoring, brand management, sales and advisory services, multi-channel management, service innovation and management life-cycle, among others. These competences host customerenterprise co-creation activities characterized by innovation, human creativity, and new technologies. Above all, these work-practices call for continuous differentiation, instead of “pouring concrete” on emerging business processes. While BPM will continue to make important contributions to the factory of enterprises, Business Process Engineering (BPE) is chartered to provide a holistic approach to new opportunities related to the life-cycle of enterprise customers and the transformation of so-called Front-Office Operations. More broadly, Business Process Engineering fosters a new space for the multidisciplinary study of process, integrating individuals, information and technology, and it does so with the goal of engineering (i.e., designing and running) innovative enterprise operations to serve customers and improve their experiences. Furthermore, given past challenges in the Back-Office, it is imperative that managers focus on processes in the Front-Office where the software industry has jumped into with solutions that bury key processes within applications, thus making differentiation and agility very difficult. BPE stresses the critical importance of the integration of Information and Behavior and it is this goal that links it with Business Informatics: the information process in organizations and society. Since behavior and information are complementary and inseparable domains of concern, current approaches to decision making based on data-only evidence should be reexamined holistically: it may be catastrophic to explicate or predict the behavior of organizations or individuals meaningfully by insisting on the ongoing divorce across the two domains. In particular, Business Informatics and Business Process Engineering offer an opportunity to address potential benefits of “big data” and “business analytics” beyond the IT domain. Having IEEE lead these directions means an opportunity for stimulating new research and practice on the most fundamental problems that enterprises and customers face today in dealing with each other. Keywords— business process engineering; customer experience; business process management; business informatics; enterprise engineering I. PROCESS IS OUT OF THE INDUSTRIALIZATION BOX Business process has been at the center of the stage in both research and industry for several decades. Under the brand of Business Process Management (BPM), business process has attracted a great deal of attention from many practitioners and scholars. BPM has been defined as the analysis, design, implementation, optimization and monitoring of business processes [70], [219], [79], [229], [230]. In [266], Van der Aalst defined some targets of BPM: ‘ ... supports business processes using methods, techniques, and software to design, enact, control and analyze operational processes involving humans, organizations, applications, documents and other sources of information” . While the above definitions are quite comprehensive and broad, in reality most BPM research and industry activity has grwon upon the motivation of reducing operating costs through automation, optimization and outsourcing. There are a several schools of thought and practice (such as lean, lean sixsigma, and others [172], [6], [4], [5]) and a myriad of related literature in the last 40 years that serve to illustrate the focus on cost contention. Around the middle of the past decade, T. Davenport stated in a celebrated Harvard Business Review paper [54] that processes were being “analyzed, standardized, and quality checked”, and that this phenomenon was happening for all sort of activities, stated in Davenport’s own terms: “from making a mouse trap to hiring a CEO”. The actual situation is that industry investment and consequential research have stayed much more on “trapping the mouse” than in differentiating customer services through innovative and more intelligent processes, let alone hiring CEOs. This may be explained partly from Davenport’s own statements: “Process standards could revolutionize how businesses work. They could dramatically increase the level and breadth of outsourcing and reduce the number of processes that organizations decide to perform for themselves” (bold face is added here for emphasis). With the advent of different technologies such as mobile, cloud, social media, and related capabilities that have empowered consumers, the classical approach and scope of business process have begun to change quickly. Organizations are adopting new operating models [100] that will drastically affect the way processes are conceived and deployed. As stated by many authors in the last four decades, business process work is supposed to cover all competences in an organization, irrespective of the specific skills from human beings participating in such operations. However, in an unpublished inspection of about 1,300 papers conducted by 1 Van der Aalst excludes strategy processes from BPM, a remarkable point that will be revisited in more depth later in this paper. the author and some of his collaborators 2 , most process examples shown in the literature deal with rather simple forms of coordination of work, mostly exhibiting a flow structure and addressing administrative tasks (like those captured in early works on office information systems). Furthermore, the examples provided usually deal with rather idealized operations, probably offered as simple examples with the only purpose of illustrating theoretical or foundational research results. Thus, radically simplified versions of “managing an order”, “approving a form”, “processing a claim”, “paying a provider”, “delivering an order” etc. are among the most popular examples of processes found in the literature. The lack of public documentation of substantial collections of real-world processes is remarkable. The authors in [106] both confirmed the dominant focus on simple business processes and also suggested potential practical consequences of related research: “... there is a growing and very active research community looking at process modeling and analysis, reference models, workflow flexibility, process mining and process-centric service-oriented architecture (SOA). However, it is clear that existing approaches have problems dealing with the enormous challenges real-life BPM projects are facing [ ... ] Conventional BPM research seems to focus on situations with just a few isolated processes ...”. Of course, the list of available real-world processes would be a lot richer if one included the set defined by enterprise packaged applications [219]. However, this comprehensive collection is proprietary because it constitutes a key piece of intellectual capital coming from software vendors or integrators in the industry. The traditional focus on process has also raised much controversy. At the S-BPM ONE Conference in 2010, a keynote speaker [176] remarked: “Let me be as undiplomatic as I possibly can be without being offensive [...] The academic community is as much to blame [...] as the vendors of BPM systems, who continue to reduce the task of managing business processes to a purely technological and automation-oriented level”. While other authors in the same conference debated “who is to blame” very animatedly [78], [234] it is important to highlight that the statement from Olbrich (in bold face above for emphasis) reinforces that BPM has mostly followed the obsession of automation and optimization by means of Information Technology. A detailed inspection of the extant literature confirms that business process work has been devoted to a rather small fraction of the actual variety and complexity found in enterprise behavior. This behavior enacts many valuegenerating capabilities that organizations cultivate based on skills provided by their own workforces and through rich interactions with other enterprise stakeholders, particularly customers. The following points offer a simplified summary: 2 At the time of this publication in IEEE, the mentioned work still remains unpublished. The co-authors are L. Flores and V. Becker both from IBM. (1) Business process research in Computer Science has been traditionally focused on certain classes of enterprise operations, mostly involving simple coordination mechanisms across tasks. This type of coordination and the overall behavior represented in underlying models reflect very much an “assembly line” where work is linearly synchronized to deliver a desired artifact or outcome. Simplicity of the choreography is ensured by removing any form of overhead in communication when moving from one stage to the next. Unlike other more complex business processes, many software applications do have this simplified structure. In fact, a trend since the early 2000’s is to separate the specific application logic from the coordination / choreography needed across modules, and both of them from the actual data contained in a data-base management system. Different foundations and a plethora of languages have been created to capture this semantics of coordination such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), Business Process Execution Languag",oceanology,17,unknown

(STI) has developed a versatile new system for parachute mission planning and rehearsal, combining the validated technology of STI's PC-based PARASIM parachute simulation system with real-time interactive networking, powerful scene generation graphics tools, and terrain-correlated wind fields. This Tactical Insertion Mission Planning and Rehearsal Simulator (TIMPARS) was developed under the SBIR program, funded by the US Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The TIMPARS system rests on four cornerstones: the PARASIM  simulation software, the real-time interactive network, the scene generation toolkit, and the terrain-correlated wind generation module. These elements combine to produce a system with which users can utilize geospecific terrain data and imagery to recreate a real-world site as a simulation scene, input actual or forecasted wind speeds and directions at altitude above the chosen location to generate a terrain-correlated wind field specific to the simulation scene, and then plan and rehearse a mission in a real-time simulation environment with multiple live participants interacting in the same virtual space. BACKGROUND STI's original parachute simulator was developed for use by smokejumpers, US Forestry Service airborne firefighters. Designed to teach round and ramair canopy control, this early version employed rudimentary graphics with a fixed monitor; users stood before the display monitor and pulled simple toggle lines to maneuver in the simulation. Despite the austere configuration, this version provided the minimum cues required to teach parachute flight safely at low cost. In 1996, STI launched a major development effort to incorporate new photo- realistic graphics and head-mounted display/virtual reality technology into the simulator. Subsequent development efforts produced malfunctions procedures software, riser controls, harness switches, and additional simulator improvements. The implementation of these enhanced simulators by the US Marine Corps (USMC) and the Military Freefall School in Yuma, AZ, resulted in a drastic drop in the rate of training injuries. In particular, the USMC First Force Reconnaissance Company experienced a 75% reduction in main canopy cutaways after implementing the enhanced simulator in the MC-5 static line deployed ram-air parachute system (SLDRAPS) transition course at Camp Pendleton, CA.

Unfortunately, currently available systems for pervasive computing, emerged from both academic and industrial research, can be adopted only on a small fraction of the devices already deployed or in production in the next future. In this paper we present an extensible programming infrastructure that turns mass-market phones into a platform for pervasive computing. 1 Mobile phone: a platform for pervasive computing Pervasive computing tries to make M. Weiser’s vision [1] a reality by saturating the environment with computing and communication devices: the most of the infrastructure is often invisible and supports user’s activities with an interaction model that is strongly human-centric. Today, almost fifteen years later, despite significant progresses in both hardware and software technologies, this vision is still not completely realizable or economically convenient. Supporting the interaction between users and the environment can be greatly simplified if we relax the interaction model and include a personal device as the access medium. Mobile phones are the most obvious candidates: they are in constant reach of their users, have wireless connectivity capabilities, and are provided with increasing computing power [2]. Even better results can be achieved with those phones that are equipped with a camera. Instead of manually getting information or editing configurations, users can point physical objects to express their will of using them: taking a picture of the objects would suffice to setup the link with the offered services. Relaying on an image acquisition device does not impose a strict limit to the share of possible users, since an always growing number of commercially available mobile phone is equipped with an integrated camera: according to recent studies [3], over 175 million camera phones were shipped in 2004 and, by the end of the decade, the global population of camera phones is expected to surpass 1 billion. ? This work is partially supported by the Italian Ministry for Education and Scientific Research (MIUR) in the framework of the FIRB-VICOM project. However, the acquisition of context-related information through images is not a trivial task, especially with resource-constrained devices. To ease the recognition process, objects can be labeled with visual tags readable by machines. Once decoded, visual tags either directly provide information about the resource they are attached to or, if the amount of information is too large, they act as resource identifiers that can be used to gather information from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and the implementation of POLPO 1 (Polpo is On-demand Loading of Pervasive-Oriented applications), a software system that turns mass-market phones into a platform for the development of pervasive applications. With POLPO, a phone with a built-in camera and compatible with the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) platform is able to get context information by decoding visual tags attached to real-world objects. POLPO supports dynamic loading and installation of custom applications used to interact with the desired resources. 2 Background and contribution In this section we summarize the most relevant solutions based on visual tags and the contribution of our system in this field. Cybercode [4] is a visual tagging system based on a two-dimensional barcode technology. The system has been used to develop several augmented reality applications where the physical world is linked to the digital space trough the use of visual tags. Cybercode is one of the first systems where visual tags can be recognized by low-cost CCD or CMOS cameras, without the need for separate and dedicated readers. Each Cybercode symbol is able to encode 24 or 48 bits of information. The system has been tested with notebook PCs and PDAs. In [5] the author presents a system that turns camera-phones into mobile sensors for two-dimensional visual tags. By recognizing a visual tag, the device can determine the coded value, as well as additional parameters, such as the viewing angle of the camera. The system includes a movement detection scheme which enables to use the mobile phone as a mouse (this is achieved by associating a coordinate scheme to visual tags). The communication capability of the mobile phone is used to retrieve information related to the selected tag and to interact with the corresponding resource. Tag recognition and motion detection algorithms were implemented in C++ for Symbian OS. The Mobile Service Toolkit (MST) [6] is a client-server framework for developing site-specific services that interact with users’ smart phones. Services are advertised by means of machine-readable visual tags, which encode the Bluetooth device address of the machine that hosts the service (Internet protocols addressing could be supported as well). Visual tags also include 15 bits of application-specific data. Once the connection has been established, MST servers can request personal information to the client to provide personalized services. Site-specific services can push user interfaces, expressed with a markup language similar to WML (Wireless Markup Language), to smart phones. MST also provide thin-client functionality: servers can push arbitrary graphics 1 The Italian name for the octopus vulgaris, a cephalopod of the order octopoda, probably the most intelligent of the invertebrates. to the phone’s display which in turn forwards all keypress events to the server. The client-side is written in C++ and requires Symbian OS. A similar approach is described in [7], where the authors propose an architecture for a platform that supports ubiquitous services. Real-world objects are linked to services on the network through visual tags based on geometric invariants that do not depend on the viewing direction [8]. But differently from other solutions, image processing does not take place on the user’s device: pictures are sent to a server where they are elaborated and converted into IDs. Instead of using two-dimensional barcodes, an alternative way of performing object recognition is the one based on radio frequency identification (RFID): small tags, attached to or incorporated into objects, that respond to queries from a reader. However this solution, that can be useful in many pervasive computing scenarios, is not particularly suitable when the interaction is mediated by mobile phones, that lack the capability of reading RFIDs. In our opinion, currently available solutions present two major drawbacks: i) they are limited to specific hw/sw platforms (i.e. Symbian OS), excluding most of the models of mobile phones already shipped and in production in the near future; ii) the software needed to interact with the environment is statically installed onto the mobile phone and cannot be dynamically expanded, e.g. to interact with new classes of resources. We designed and developed a system for pervasive computing based on visual tags that overcomes these constraints as follows. Compatibility with J2ME The system runs on devices compatible with the J2ME platform. This environment is quite limited in terms of both memory and execution speed, but also extremely popular (nearly all mobile phones produced). This required the implementation of a pure Java decoder of visual tags for the J2ME environment. Downloadable applications Our system is based on the idea that the interaction with a given class of resources, e.g. printers, public displays, etc., takes place through a custom application. New custom applications can be downloaded from the network and installed onto the user’s device as needed. This brings two advantages: i) the classes of resources that can be used do not have to be known a priori; ii) the user’s device, that is resource constrained, includes only the software needed to interact with the services actually used. The J2ME platform comprises two configurations, few profiles, and several optional packages. The J2ME configurations identify different classes of devices: the Connected Device Configuration (CDC) is a framework that supports the execution of Java application on embedded devices such as network equipment, set-top boxes, and personal digital assistants; the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) defines the Java runtime for resource constrained devices as mobile phones and pagers. Our systems runs on top of the version 1.1 of the CLDC, that provides support for floating point arithmetics (unavailable in version 1.0). The adopted profile is the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) that, together with CLDC, provides a complete Java application environment for mobile phones. 3 System architecture POLPO requires that physical resources are labeled with visual tags, and that a program providing access to POLPO functionalities is installed onto the user’s device. This program has the following primary functions: – Decoding of visual tags. The image captured with the built-in camera is processed to extract the data contained into the visual tag. – Management of custom applications. The program downloads and installs the custom application required to interact with a resource. Usually, resources of the same kind share the same custom application (i.e., a single application is used to interact with all printers, another is used with public displays, etc). – Management of user’s personal data. In many cases, applications need information about the user to provide customized services. For this reason, the software installed on mobile phones includes a module that manages user’s personal data and stores them into the persistent memory. Managed data comprise user’s name, telephone number, email address, homepage, etc. Each resource is identified and described by a Data Matrix visual tag. Da",oceanology,20,unknown

Examples of such monitoring and detection include target tracking based on acoustic signatures and line-of-bearing estimation, climate control, intrusion detection, etc. The advances in low-power radio technology are making wireless communication within sensor networks an attractive option. However, it is typically difficult or impossible to replenish energy resources available to a portable sensor node, once it is deployed. Maximizing the life of sensor nodes is an overriding priority, and different energy optimization techniques are being developed to addresses computation/communication tradeoffs. A large number of research efforts are focusing on different aspects of the general problem of designing efficient sensor network-based systems where the metrics to measure efficiency vary from system to system. With technological advancements such as silicon-based radios expected to become a reality in a few years, designers of sensor network-based systems will be faced with an extremely large set of design decisions. Each choice will affect the overall system performance in ways that might not always be cleanly modeled. In addition to the research challenges in design and optimization, the practical aspects of designing real-world sensor networks will become equally important. For example, the ability of the design framework to allow rapid specification and evaluation of a particular network configuration is crucial for a more exhaustive exploration of the design space. A design environment for future sensor networks should provide tools and formal methodologies that will allow designers to model, analyze, optimize, and simulate such systems. In the context of our work, design and optimization of a sensor network application involves determining the task allocation to different sensor nodes and the inter-node communication mechanism. Design of the sensor node hardware itself is also an area of active research. However, we assume that a set of node architectures is already available to our enduser, and the design problem is restricted to using the available hardware (with flexibilities, if any, such as dynamic voltage scaling) to efficiently implement the target application. We take a simple, seven-node wireless sensor network for acoustic detection [5] (Automatic Target Recognition) as the case study and demonstrate (i) a modeling and simulation methodology for a class of sensor networks, and (ii) a software framework that implements our methodology. Our formal application model is illustrated in Fig. 1. We use a data flow graph representation to model the computing tasks and their data dependencies. The end-to-end application consists of two types of such data flow graphs: the first type denotes the processing that has to be performed for each sample before it is ready to be ‘fused’ with results from other sensors, and the second type represents the computing involved in data fusion. Specifically , in our case study, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation is the only task that is performed on each block of sampled data. The outputs of FFTs from all seven nodes are provided as an input to the collaborative computing part, which consists of delay and sum beamforming (BF), and lineof-bearing (LOB) estimation. The result of collaborative computation in such a cluster model of sensor networks has to be transmitted to some observer. This is accomplished by designating one of the nodes as the cluster-head, which could be equipped with more powerful communication facilities than other sensor nodes. All communication within our cluster is one-hop, and processing of a particular data sample (FFT/BF/LOB) occurs either on its home node, or the cluster-head, or partly on both. Simulating a completely specified instance of the above class of sensor networks involves many challenges. None of the existing network simulators to our knowledge models the internal architecture of the processing nodes in the network. This is because the focus of most network simulators is on protocol development and empirical analysis. Except in areas such as high-speed router design, the node internals have little or no impact on decisions related to protocol design. Also, processor simulators do not model the environment outside the chip boundary. Therefore, to obtain detailed and accurate performance estimates for the entire system, we propose a technique to automatically generate network scenarios based on results from low-level node simulations. The network simulator is configured using the generated scenarios, and the individual simulation results are merged and presented to the end-user as a whole. Such a ‘horizontal’ simulation is accomplished through the use of a central data repository for model information, which means that the simulators never have to directly interact with each other. The simulators we integrate provide estimates about energy consumption, thereby assisting in a power/performance analysis of a specific system configuration. Our design framework facilitates multi-granular simulation, i.e., simulating the same system configuration by using simulation models at different levels of abstraction. Typically, coarse-grained models provide rapid estimates, but need to make approximations about system behavior that might not be very accurate. For such a scenario, we demonstrate a form of analytical model refinement (see Fig. 2), i.e. the data from low-level simulations can be automatically processed to ‘distill’ parameter values used by high-level simulators. Naturally, the exact processing has to be specified by someone with knowledge of the analytical model semantics. Our design environment provides the following capabilities to the user: • To graphically describe the target application, node architecture, network configuration, and task-to-node mapping. • To change (reconfigure) the system model to explore alternate designs. Some of the parameters that can be manipulated by the designer include receive/transmit power of the radio, voltage/frequency setting of the processor, cluster geometry, propagation models, etc. • To automatically simulate a design using a coarse system model. • To automatically configure and execute low-level simulators for the node (Wattch [3]) and the network (ns-2 [4]) and obtain system-wide energy and latency estimates. • To automatically update high-level model parameters using low-level simulation statistics. • To graphically visualize simulation results and facilitate (manual) identification of power/performance bottlenecks in the design. This work is an illustration of the general approach of the MILAN [1] project. A modeling and simulation framework based on the first version of the 7-node ATR system model was implemented in [2]. The primary focus of that work was a prototype demonstration of simulator integration and model refinement. Therefore, the system model itself lacked generality. Also, we use a relatively more detailed version of the high-level estimator implemented for [2]. This work represents a significant step towards the ultimate goal of a design environment for automatic optimization and synthesis of sensor network applications.",oceanology,21,unknown

The main advantages are dynamic modelling and visual interpretation of the traffic conditions. This tool is ideal to test geometric designs, traffic controls and a variety of traffic management measures. These include incident and congestion management, road works, ramp metering, VMS, etc. It is an extremely suitable tool to use when low cost solutions must be found because of severely limited infrastructure resources. Times that micro simulation was not able to calculate and show reliable traffic situations is over, various traffic simulation models have developed and have reached high quality standards. Micro simulation is about to gain a real market share all around the world; South Africa is following. Modelling toll plazas at interchanges on the N4 Platinum Toll Road is used to illustrate the advantages of micro simulation. Geometric design options, measures effecting toll throughput and traffic control options were evaluated in this example as well as the estimation of the expected life span of various options within a congested network. The package used in this study is AIMSUN2, an advanced micro simulation package widely used internationally that can interact with TRANSYT, SCOOT, EMME/2 and SATURN. AIMSUN2 has been applied to traffic impact analysis, traffic control measures, HOV-lanes, tolling and geometric design within the last three years in South Africa. It has also been used successfully to convey results of investigations to nontechnical people. 1. MICRO SIMULATION 1.1 Background on the development of micro simulation The microscopic traffic simulation models are based on the reproduction of the traffic flows simulating the behavior of the individual vehicles, this not only enables them to capture the full dynamics of time dependent traffic phenomena, but also to deal with behavioral models accounting for drivers’ reactions. The underlying hypothesis is that the dynamics of a stream of traffic is the result of a series of drivers’ attempts to regulate their speed and acceleration accordingly with information received. The driver’s actions resulting from the interpretation of the information received will consist on the control of the acceleration (braking and accelerating), the control of heading (steering) and the decision of overtaking the precedent vehicle either to increase the speed or to position themselves in the right lane to perform a maneuver (i.e. a turning). The origins of microscopic traffic simulation can be traced back to the early stages of digital computers. Although the basic principles were set up many years ago, with the seminal work of, among others, Robert Hermann and the General Motors Group in the early fifties, the computing requirements made them impractical until hardware and software developments made them affordable even on today’s laptop computers. Most of the currently existing microscopic traffic simulators are based on the family of carfollowing, lane changing and gap acceptance models to model the vehicle’s behavior. Carfollowing models are a form of stimulus-response model, where the response is the reaction of the driver (follower) to the motion of the vehicle immediately preceding him (the leader) in the traffic stream. The response of the follower is to accelerate or decelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the stimulus at time t after a reaction time T. The generic form of the conceptual model is: response (t+T) = sensitivity * stimulus (t) Among the most used models are Helly’s model (1), implemented in SITRA-B+, (2), Herman’s model (3), or its improved version by Wicks (4), implemented in MITSIM, (5), the psycho-physical model of Wiedemann, (6), used in VISSIM (7), or the ad hoc version of Gipps (8), used in AIMSUN2 (9, 10). Other microscopic simulators such as INTEGRATION (11) and PARAMICS employ heuristic or other modeling not publicly available in analytic form. A common drawback of most of these models is that the model parameters are global i.e. constant for the entire network whereas it is well know that driver’s behavior is affected by traffic conditions. Therefore a more realistic car-following modeling for microscopic simulation should account for local behavior. This implies that some of the model parameters must be local depending on local geometric and traffic conditions. 1.2 What micro simulation is and the advantages thereof compared to static models The deployment of Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) requires support of complementary studies clearly showing the feasibility of the systems and what benefits should be expected from their operation. The large investments required have to be justified in a robust way. That means feasibility studies that validate the proposed systems, assess their expected impacts and provide the basis for sound cost benefit analyses. Microscopic traffic simulation has proven to be a useful tool to achieve these objectives. This is not only due to its ability to capture the full dynamics of time dependent traffic phenomena, but also being capable of dealing with behavioral models accounting for drivers’ reactions when exposed to ITS systems. The advent of ITS has created new objectives and requirements for micro-simulation models. Quoting from Deliverable D3 of the European Commission Project SMARTEST [12]: “The objective of micro-simulation models is essentially, from the model designers point of view, to quantify the benefits of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), primarily Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) and Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS). Micro-simulation is used for evaluation prior to or in parallel with on-street operation. This covers many objectives such as the study of dynamic traffic control, incident management schemes, real-time route guidance strategies, adaptive intersection signal controls, ramp and mainline metering, etc. Furthermore some models try to assess the impact and sensitivity of alternative design parameters”. The analysis of traffic systems and namely ITS systems, is beyond the capabilities of traditional static transport planning models. Microscopic simulation is then the suitable analysis tool to achieve the required objectives. An example from a real case study where microscopic simulation was used to complement static modeling will help us to understand better how both levels may help the decisionmaker. The city of San Sebastian, in the North of Spain, completed recently a new urban freeway connecting two separated neighborhoods. Figure 1 shows the typical result of the planning study with an close up of the Amara neighborhood. The road network and the demand were modeled using the EMME/2 package. The figure displays the expected impacts of the new infrastructure highlighting in green the average flow reduction due to the redistribution of flows enabled by the new paths on the network, and in red the increase of flows attracted by these paths. A significant discharge in the level of congestion in the main road network was the foreseen impact of the new infrastructure, but the access to the new freeway in the East-West direction shows some undesirable side effects in the neighborhood (Amara) inside the rectangle. The solutions to these problems demands a close up to the subnetwork and take decisions at the level of traffic control and traffic management schemes, not excluding even a partial reshaping of part of the street network. This type of decision requires a more detailed modeling, able of reproducing in a very accurate way the traffic conditions, accounting for the interactions between the vehicular flows and the infrastructure, and obviously including the influence of the traffic lights, objective that can only be achieved by a microscopic traffic simulation model. Figure 1: Expected impact of the new infrastructure in San Sebastian with an close up of the Amara neighborhood Figure 2 displays the corresponding model built with the AIMSUN2 traffic simulation software, the EMME/2 sub model has been built automatically from the AIMSUN2 model by means of an interface between both systems. Figure 2: AIMSUN2 micro simulation model of the Amara neighborhood The type of information that micro simulation can provide for a further analysis is beyond the capabilities of traditional static models. The average flows from sections to sections turning movements) for the allowed movements at selected intersections in the model, speeds and delays for every simulated time interval can be obtained. The dynamic analysis for a time period is completed with values for other traffic variables or indicators of the quality of service as number of stops, time delayed at stops, average queue lengths, etc. Figure 3 provide a further insight on the capacity of analysis provided by dynamic simulation software. The graphic in this figure describes the evolution over time of average flows. The same type of graph can be produced for average queue lengths on a subset of selected sections in the model. Figure 3: The evolution of average flows over time 1.3 The ease of model building and data input (AIMSUN2) The recent evolution of the microscopic simulators has taken advantages of the state-of-theart in the development of object-oriented simulators, and graphical user interfaces, as well as the new trends in software design and the available tools that support it adapted to traffic modeling requirements. A proper achievement of the basic requirements of a microscopic simulator implies building models as close to reality as possible. The closer the model is to reality the more data demanding it become. This has been traditionally the main barrier Section Volumes (Veh/h) 0 200 400 600 80",oceanology,22,not included

Looking at some extreme cases, you cannot use the same level of abstraction when simulating the evolution of the universe on a grand scale as when simulating protein folding. You can always trade execution time for increased detail or scope, but assuming you want a result in a reasonable time scale, compromises are necessary. A corollary to the abstraction rule is that simulation is a workload that can always use maximum computer performance (unless it is limited by the speed of interaction from the world or users). A faster computer or less detailed model lets you scale up the size of the system simulated or reduce simulation run times. In general, if the processor in your computer is not loaded to 100%, you are not making optimal use of simulation. The high demands for computer power used to be a limiting factor for the use of simulation, requiring large, expensive, and rare supercomputers to be used. Today, however, even the cheapest PC has sufficient computation power to perform relevant simulations in reasonable time. Thus, the availability of computer equipment is not a problem anymore, and simulation should be a tool considered for deployment to every engineer in a development project. Simulating the Environment Simulation of the physical environment is often done for its own sake, without regard for the eventual use of the simulation model by embedded software developers. It is standard practice in mechanical and electrical engineering to design with computer aided tools and simulation. For example, control engineers developing control algorithms for physical systems such as engines or processing plants often build models of the controlled system in tools such as MatLab/Simulink and Labview. These models are then combined with a model of the controller under development, and control properties like stability and performance evaluated. From a software perspective, this is simulating the specification of the embedded software along with the controlled environment. For a space probe, the environment simulation could comprise a model of the planets, the sun, and the probe itself. This model can be used to evaluate proposed trajectories, since it is possible to work through missions of years in length in a very short time. In conjunction with embedded computer simulations, such a simulator would provide data on the attitude and distance to the sun, the amount of power being generated from solar panels, and the positions of stars seen by the navigation sensors. When the mechanical component of an embedded system is potentially dangerous or impractical to work with, you absolutely want to simulate the effects of the software before committing to physical hardware. For example, control software for heavy machinery or military vehicles are best tested in simulation. Also, the number of physical prototypes available is fairly limited in such circumstances, and not something every developer will have at their desk. Such models can be created using modeling tools, or written in C or C++ (which is quite popular in practice). In many cases, environment simulations can be simple data sequences captured from a real sensor or simply guessed by a developer. It should be noted that a simulated environment can be used for two different purposes. One is to provide “typical” data to the computer system simulation, trying to mimic the behavior of the final physical system under normal operating conditions. The other is to provide “extreme” data, corresponding to boundary cases in the system behavior, and “faulty” data corresponding to broken sensors or similar cases outside normal operating conditions. The ability to inject extreme and faulty cases is a key benefit from simulation. Simulating the Human User Interface The human interface portion of an embedded device is often also simulated during its development. For testing user interface ideas, rapid prototyping and simulation is very worthwhile and can be done in many different ways. One creative example is how the creator of the original Palm Pilot used a wooden block to simulate the effect of carrying the device. Instead of building complete implementations of the interface of a TV, mobile phone, or plant control computer, mockups are built in specialized user interface (UI) tools, in Visual Studio GUI builder on a PC, or even PowerPoint or Flash. Sometimes such simulations have complex behaviors implemented in various scripts or even simple prototype software stacks. Only when the UI design is stable do you commit to implementing it in real code for your real device, since this typically implies a greater programming effort. In later phases of development, when the hardware user interface and most of the software user interface is done, a computer simulation of a device needs to provide input and output facilities to make it possible to test software for the device without hardware. This kind of simulation runs the gamut from simple text consoles showing the output from a serial port to graphical simulations of user interface panels where the user can click on switches, turn knobs, and watch feedback on graphical dials and screens. A typical example is Nokia’s Series 60 development kit, which provides a virtual mobile phone with a keypad and small display. Another example is how virtual PC tools like VmWare and Parallels map the display, keyboard, and mouse of a PC to a target system. In consumer electronics, PC peripherals are often used to provide live test data approximating that of a real system. For example, a webcam is a good test data generator for a simulated mobile phone containing a camera. Even if the optics and sensors are different, it still provides something better than static predetermined images. Same for sound capture and playback – you want to hear the sound the machine is making, not just watch the waveform on a display. Simulating the Network Most embedded computers today are connected to one or more networks. These networks can be internal to a system; for example, in a rack-based system, VME, PCI, PCI Express, RapidIO, Ethernet, IC, serial lines, and ATM can be used to connect the boards. In cars, CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and MOST buses connect body electronics, telematics, and control systems. Aircraft control systems communicate over special bus systems like MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, and AFDX. Between the external interfaces of systems, Ethernet running internet standards like UDP and TCP is common. Mobile phones connect to headsets and PCs over Bluetooth, USB, and IR, and to cellular networks using UMTS, CDMA2000, GSM, and other standards. Telephone systems have traffic flowing using many different protocols and physical standards like SS7, SONET, SDH, and ATM. Smartcards connect to card readers using contacts or contact-less interfaces. Sensor nodes communicate over standard wireless networks or lower-power, lower-speed interfaces like Zigbee. Thus, existing in an internal or external network is a reality for most embedded systems. Due to the large scale of a typical network, the network part is almost universally simulated to some extent. You simply cannot test a phone switch or router inside its real deployment network, so you have to provide some kind of simulation for the external world. You don’t want to test mobile phone viruses in the live network for very practical reasons. Often, many other nodes on the network are being developed at the same time. Or you might just want to combine point simulations of several networked systems into a single simulated network. Network simulation can be applied at many levels of the networking stack. The picture below shows the most common levels at which network simulation is being performed. The two levels highlighted in green are the ones that are most useful for embedded software work on a concrete target model. Physical signalling Bit stream Packet transmission Network protocol Application protocol High-level application actions Analog signals, bit errors, radio modeling Clocked zeros and ones, CAN with contention, Ethernet with CSMA model Ethernet packets with MAC address, CAN packets, serial characters, VME data read/write TCP/IP etc. FTP, DHCP, SS7, CANopen Load software, configure node, restart Hardware/software boundary r r / ft r r The most detailed modeling level is the physical signal level. Here, the analog properties of the transmission medium and how signals pass through it is modeled. This makes it possible to simulate radio propagation, echoes, and signal degradation, or the electronic interference caused by signals on a CAN bus. It is quite rarely used in the setting of developing embedded systems software, since it complex and provides more details than strictly needed. Bit stream simulation looks at the ones and zeroes transmitted on a bus or other medium. It is possible to detect events like transmission collisions on Ethernet and the resulting back-off, priorities being clocked onto a CAN bus, and signal garbling due to simultaneous transmissions in radio networks. An open example of such a simulator is the VMNet simulator for sensor networks. Considering the abstraction levels for computer system simulation discussed below, this is at an abstraction level similar to cycle-accurate simulation. Another example is the simulation of the precise clock-by-clock communication between units inside a system-on-a-chip. Packet transmission passes entire packets around, where the definition of a packet depends on the network type. In Ethernet, packets can be up to 65kB large, while serial lines usually transmit single bytes in each “packet”. It is the network simulation equivalent of transaction-level modeling, as discussed below for computer boards. The network simulation has no knowledge of the meaning of the packets. It just passes opaqu",oceanology,23,unknown

Digitally enhanced guides have many advantages over traditional paper-based indoor guides, most of all that they can be aware of their current context and display dynamic information. That is why particularly shopping malls recently started deploying indoor assistance applications for mobile phones, which also include support for navigation. Moreover, as we show in the paper, projected interfaces offer additional distinct advantages over static guides and even traditional or augmented reality mobile applications. We describe five concepts for a shopping mall indoor assistance system based on projector phones, comprising support for shop selection, precise way finding, “virtual fitting” of clothes, and context-aware and ambient advertisements. We then apply the concepts to a typical shopping scenario, where users wear the phone at their belt and constantly project the interface in front of them. Expected benefits of our system are that people find their way quicker, easier, and less distracted from their usual shopping experience. Finally, we discuss the technical feasibility of our envisioned implementation and research questions we are particularly interested in. INTRODUCTION Navigation and location-based services for pedestrians recently gained a lot of attention and are becoming rapidly adopted. Very popular among these are applications for location-based places recommendations and turn-by-turn navigation. While these applications mostly focus on outdoor navigation, less attention has been paid to the opportunities for providing indoor assistance with mobile devices. Especially in large complex buildings, e.g. shopping centers, in most cases static signs, You-Are-Here maps, or paper flyer maps are still the only available navigation assistance for visitors. Preliminary observations and interviews we conducted in nearby shopping centers show that, at least in Germany, available navigational aids are still as insufficient as Levine reported them to be almost 30 years ago [8]. Despite a lot of research projects that explored indoor assistance over the last decade, it was not before the beginning of 2011 that we saw the first mobile shopping applications reaching consumer markets, such as the Sam’s Club mobile application [1], which provides indoor navigation to specific items and/or shops in some selected American shopping malls. Similarly, some shopping centers in Asia introduced mobile AR applications for shopping assistance [2]. In our research group we study future application areas of projector phones, i.e. mobile phones with integrated projectors (see [11] for a detailed survey). We found projector phones to provide some distinguished advantages for indoor navigation assistance, e.g., that interaction can be handsfree and the projection can serve as ambient display, thereby not contradicting the traditional shopping experience. Further that the surrounding world can be directly augmented, freeing the user from mapping between mobile display and real world and that the output space is much larger than on mobile displays. And finally, that bystander can see and attach to the projected output. RELATED WORK We present relevant work dealing with mobile shopping, recommender systems, indoor positioning and navigation. One of the first works on digital mobile shopping assistants has been done by Asthana et al. [3]. They presented main usage scenarios, e.g., telling people where to find certain products or informing them on discounts and special offers. Similar can be recognized in aforementioned mobile shopping applications and as well in recently filed patents, e.g. from Apple Inc. (US 2010/0198626 A1, US 2010/0191578 A1), which include navigation, service interactions (e.g., parking tickets), and support for social networking. Yang et al. [15] developed a location-aware recommender system. It learns a customer’s interests from previously visited product websites and continuously presents a list of products around the customer’s current location, that are likely to interest him. The software also takes into account the distance to shops and is able to learn customer’s preference between highly interesting products and far distances. Butz et al. [4] present a hybrid indoor navigation system that is able to adapt route instructions to different output devices (screen resolution, device resources) and based on the precision of available location information. Results from [7,14] indicate that intelligent fusion of infrastructure techniques, e.g. GPS, GSM triangulation, and sensors like accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, enables precise indoor location tracking with current commercially available smartphones in unaltered environments. Kray et al. [6] explore the design space of routing instructions for pedestrians on mobile devices. Narzt et al. present a specific mobile application for augmented reality (AR) [10]. Alternative systems for pedestrian navigation are the Rotating Compass by Rukzio et al. [12], showing personalised navigation information on public displays and the CabBoots system by Frey [5], which guides users by means of tactile output in the shoes. Aforementioned techniques, with the exception of the last two, rely on holding a handset device. However, we feel strongly inclined that holding a device in hand for a longer time does not fit well the traditional shopping experience. Negative side effects, e.g., arm fatigue, regular switching of the field of view, do not allow using the shopping assistance application as constant companion. CONCEPT In our envisioned prototype, people wear their projector phone on their belt, projecting a display right in front of their feet (Figure 1). In the following we present five concepts for mobile shopping assistance that are enabled by projector phones. Later we apply these concepts to a typical shopping scenario. Shadow Interaction Since our concept expects people to wear the projector fixed to the belt most of the time, direct interaction with the mobile device would not be sufficient as the only interaction technique. Audio is not an alternative because of the noisy environment in a shopping mall. This leaves users with the option to directly interact with the projection, either by feet or hands (or gaze in the future). In preliminary studies we discovered that foot-based interaction is not well suited due to the fact that foot movement inherently involves movement of the body at the same time, which makes interaction cumbersome. We found interacting with the shadow of a finger in front of the projection a much more promising solution. Figure 2 shows the stroke of the resulting shadow on the projection. With the tip of the shadow, all points on the projection can be reached. Items should be highlighted once the shadow reaches their bounding box to give adequate feedback to the user. Although the tracking of the finger’s height to enable traditional press/release behaviors would be possible, this would require the user to maintain a complex mental model of different finger height levels. Instead, our concept builds on the fact, that the tip of the index finger can be moved well without changing the shape of the rest of the hand or even the middle knuckle of the index finger. Thus, to select an item, a user moves the index finger to point on the desired item and then bends the index finger and unbends it again. Alternatively, one could use the finger’s dwell time as in Microsoft’s Kinect. To the best of our knowledge, shadow interaction with projections has not been reported before. Radar of Recommendations Another concept that is particularly useful with projected navigation is a radar of recommendations. Building on [15], we want to constantly show and update a personal radar of products the user might be interested in (Figure 2). Based on the information available from accounts with online stores (e.g., Amazon) and items recently explored with our system (see fourth concept), users see offers of nearby stores in front of them and can select these items to start a navigation in the middle of the circle. The size of an item conveys the expected interest of the user, the distance from the middle depicts the walking distance (not air path) from the user’s current location. The size of the radius of interest (distance to shops and items) can be adjusted by slightly changing the angle of the projector, similarly to looking further ahead. Different from [15], the projection provides a much larger output space and the radar serves as ambient display in the user’s periphery. Projected (augmented) Navigation When the user selected an item or shop he is interested in, the assistance system starts a projected navigation. In outdoor navigation, turn-by-turn navigation is still the most prominent, though we have seen augmented reality been used in research [10]. Especially for indoor navigation, where there are more tight and subsequent turns or small decision spaces (take the left stairs up, not the right stairs down) our experience is that turn-by-turn navigation does not work well. Therefore, we want the user not to follow Figure 1: The projector is worn at different locations on the belt (left and middle) and can optionally be taken into hand to change the angle of the projection (right). Figure 2: The user interacts with his radar of recommendations through the shadow of his finger. The orange outline shows the shadow, the left red circle the fingertip that, for clicking, can be changed independently of the finger’s middle knuckle (right circle) or the rest of the hand’s shape. this type of directions, but instead simply follow a blue line projected in front of her (see Figure 3). Since the projector phone is spatially-aware, both in terms of location and orientation, the blue line is projected as a static augmentation of the real world, i",oceanology,25,unknown

The functionality of a peer is implemented by a P2P application which de nes the behavior of the whole P2P system. The equivalence of peers is realized by providing client functionality as well as server functionality. Implementing a P2P system with speci ed behavior is a di cult task because the behavior depends on many factors, such as the used P2P search methods and the underlying physical network. Some factors cannot be taken into account completely because of their complexity or unknown or not understood parts. For instance, the prospective user behavior may only be estimated based on observed data. When engineering complex, dynamic software systems such as P2P systems, simulation is often used to analyze the properties of these systems based on simulation models in an early development phase. With simulations in natural sciences, the separation of reality and (simulation) model is clear: the reality exists in nature, while the model exists as software within some computer system. When simulating software systems, this separation is not so obvious: the simulated model is itself a software system. With P2P systems, for instance, a simpli ed P2P system is modeled and simulated for predicting properties of real P2P systems. The new software engineering contribution of this work is the Peer Software Engineering (PeerSE) method, which allows a controlled transition from simulation models to real-world software systems. The method starts with a comparative analysis of simulation models for P2P systems and proceeds iteratively toward the experimental implementation in a laboratory setting and nally a real-world P2P system deployed in a target environment. The method includes a simulation model for P2P systems and a tool supporting the execution of simulation and laboratory experiments. Simulation is an essential part of the PeerSE method used to identify and to compare models ful lling given requirements. When an appropriate model has been found, model components can be reused and further re ned to implement a laboratory P2P system. To allow for a controlled transition of model components to laboratory components, the results of simulation and laboratory experiments are directly compared using the same metrics. The applicability of the PeerSE method has been successfully evaluated by analyzing and realizing a P2P system for distributed software development.",oceanology,26,unknown

Therefore, the virtual sound space might be unnatural. The authors developed a software-based virtual auditory display (VAD) that outputs audio signals for a set of headphones with a three-dimensional position sensor. The VAD software can display a dynamic virtual auditory space that is responsive to a listener's head movement. Subjective evaluations were conducted to clarify the relation between the perceived reality of virtual sound space and ambient sound. Evaluation results of the reality of the virtual sound space displayed by the VAD software are introduced.",space,29,unknown

that performance differences in this simulator-based challenge do not persist
after physical deployment. This gap is largely due to AI agents learning to
exploit simulator imperfections, abusing collision dynamics to 'slide' along
walls, leading to shortcuts through otherwise non-navigable space. Naturally,
such exploits do not work in the real world. Our experiments show that it is

Instead, following the principle of synergy leads to the conviction that there is always a certain model of optimal complexity e.g. in the synthesis of the new system, and in the analysis of real system peculiarities. However, the model of reality could be a part of this reality that is included to the carefully structured formal description.  Since we cannot penetrate into the working space of the serial engine while testing, we should use a test engine of a special construction when the working space corresponds to the laws of similarity and this engine will serve as a model of the working space of the serial engine.

The study illustrates the effectiveness of hard-soft technology while investigating the peculiarities of heat generation and heat consumption in the internal combustion engine, which will combine mathematic and algorithmic means of modelling as well as the means of real simulation. The necessity of hard-soft technology introduction arises from the excessive complexity of thermal phenomena occurring in the internal combustion engine (ICE), and the inability to fully subordinate these phenomena to existing analytical models.
The combination of original and analytical properties, reality and virtual reality while modelling the processes in internal combustion engines allows us to substantially improve the quality of information in the process of design and engine construction. Taking this into consideration, there are some natural grounds to apply principles of heuristic self-organization, self-learning, means of the neural networks, etc. in the design implementation.
The study demonstrates the example of modelling the real working space of ICE with the forced start that serves as a supplement to the mathematical algorithmic two-zone model of heat generation / heat consumption / heat extraction.
The basic information that can be obtained by means of hard-soft technology in the framework of, for example, the two-zone model of the work process in the gasoline engine, is the variability with the change in the angle of rotation of the crankshaft of the engine: absolute pressure (indicative diagram); absolute temperature; heat transmitted inside the cylinder between zones; coefficient of excess air; coefficient of heat transfer; intensity of heat extraction in the process of combustion of fuel; intensity of heat transfer through the walls of the cylindeДетерміністичне і в певному сенсі «лінійне» трактування світу часто веде до визнання того, що чим точнішою потрібна його модель, тим складнішою вона має бути (як у разі формалізованого відтворення реальної системи, так і у разі втілення бажаних системних властивостей у процесі формалізованого синтезу чогось нового). Натомість дотримання принципу синергетичності веде до переконання, що завжди існує якась модель оптимальної складності — і тоді, коли йдеться про синтез нової системи, і тоді, коли провадиться аналіз властивостей реальної системи. Але ж моделлю реальності може слугувати також і якась частина цієї реальності, долучена до ретельно структурованого формального опису. Оскільки дослідними засобами проникнути в робочий простір серійного двигуна нема змоги, то доводиться використовувати дослідний двигун особливої конструкції, робочий простір якого відповідає законам подібності і слугуватиме моделлю-аналогом робочого простору серійного двигуна.
Мета роботи — обґрунтувати ефективність hard-soft-технології дослідження особливостей теплотворення і теплоспоживання в двигуні внутрішнього згоряння, яка б системно поєднувала в собі засоби математичного й алгоритмічного моделювання та засоби натурного симулювання. Необхідність впровадження hard-soft-технології випливає з надмірної складності теплових явищ, що перебігають у двигуні внутрішнього згоряння, та неможливості уповні підпорядкувати ці явища існуючим аналітичним модельним уявленням.
Поєднання натурності та аналітичності, реальності та віртуальності в моделюванні процесів у двигунах внутрішнього згоряння дозволяє принципово підвищити якість інформаційного забезпечення процесу проектування й конструювання двигунів. При цьому виникають природні підстави для втілення у моделювання принципів евристичної самоорганізації, самонавчання, засобів штибу нейронних мереж тощо.

Augmented reality software is frequently the seal of approval that realtors receive in order to grow their business and overcome these obstacles. This paper proposes a method for projecting a home onto an image target and allowing the user to explore the interior of the house. Voice controllers incorporated into AR can control the interior.",e-commerce,35,not included

In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.



The large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.



Here we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.



We have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.



Two advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.



Finally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",oceanology,40,not included

Capturing and defining scenarios/edge cases, various and heterogenous datasets, multiple sensors/sensorfusion architectures, and perception algorithms are just a few of the many challenges we are facing when implementing such systems. To cope with such levels of complexity, modular approaches are required. Such approaches target flexibility and standardized interfaces between data provided by various sensor modules/models and driving functions. In the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain, and more precisely when dealing with supervised training of Neural Networks (NN), obtaining valid and accurately labeled datasets is essential. By enabling Machine Learning (ML) in electromagnetic applications, Ansys physics-based Real Time Radar (RTR) introduces a new paradigm for sensor development and integration that leverages GPU hardware and new algorithms to accelerate simulation by orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. In this paper, a comprehensive workflow for the generation of virtual datasets using the Open Simulation Interface (OSI) will be presented. This workflow will illustrate how the scenario variation process coupled with RTR facilitates the creation of heterogenous/labeled datasets that are ready for training object detection NN. Finally, this presentation will also show the preliminary results obtained when implementing this process. Introduction Machine Learning (ML) is gradually taking over “conventional” algorithms that were previously designed to help make Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) a reality. Several auto giants like BMW, VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 83 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19.

Others, like Tesla [1] are solely relying on ML and in some cases Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide an end-to-end solution. AVs usually rely on several sensors of different types to perceive their surrounding environment. As such sensors continuously scan the environment and generate raw data, the perception stack processes this data and generates a meaningful virtual map of the surrounding environment. In the area of Computer Vision (CV), usually relying on optical systems, ML algorithms are already successfully deployed in commercial systems [2] – [4]. In addition to optical systems, and due to their superior performances in bad weather conditions and dark environments, radars have also made their way into the AV’s sensor stacks. Though not frequently encountered, ML has also been used to replace some of the traditional radar signal processing algorithms. For example, in [5] the author demonstrates how a fully convolutional network can be used for object detection and 3D estimation using a Frequency-Modulated ContinuousWave (FMCW) radar. Contrary to [5], which is using real data for the training process, the author in [6] illustrates the power of physics-based simulation to also demonstrate the feasibility of using ML approaches to solve radar-based perception problems. As the training process of ML algorithms highly relies on labeled training data, Ansys’ Real Time Radar (RTR) automates generation of labeled data sets by shifting data generation and labeling from the real world to the virtual world. In addition, having an API which is compatible with the Open Simulation Interface (OSI) [7] ensures that a standardized interface is being deployed to describe the virtual environment in which generated scenarios are executed. Finally, this paper illustrates how, with the help of Ansys optiSlang [8], a tool chain is developed to orchestrate the scenario variation process and the simulation workflow to automatically generate labeled datasets for training a Neural Network (NN) based object detection algorithm. Ansys Real Time Radar RTR is an all-GPU implementation of the shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) method optimized for the automotive radar application to simulate a scenario in real time/faster than real time. The simulation, which is based on an arbitrary 3D scene/actor geometry, electrical material VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 84 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19.

As an output, RTR can generate raw I and I+Q A/D data for multi-channel radars in dynamically changing driving scenarios. Objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, road, infrastructure, etc.) can be assigned arbitrary positions, orientations, linear and angular velocities in a scene graph hierarchy through a light-weight API to characterize complex traffic scenarios with negligible simulation overhead. To measure Doppler velocity, automotive radars transmit, receive, and process hundreds of chirps over each Coherent Processing Interval (CPI). Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) and several post processing algorithms are then applied to hundreds of samples from each chirp/CPI to obtain range-Doppler (RD) images, which will be used for Neural Network (NN) training. These images, as represented in Fig. 1, give a visualization of all scattered fields in terms of relative velocity (Doppler) and distance from the radar (range). Fig. 1: Example of Range-Doppler image. As previously mentioned, RTR includes a lightweight C++ and Python API, enabling it to be integrated into nearly any driving simulator available on the market. In Fig. 2 the API’s main interfaces are depicted. VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 85 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19.

Starting from left to right, the API give the user access to the following: 1. “Radar Config” enables the user to configure radar waveforms, radar modes, and antenna patterns. Radar waveforms are defined by parameters such as center frequency, bandwidth, number of frequency samples, CPI duration, number of chirps, number of transmit and receive antennas, and relative antenna positions. 2. “Object and Materials” helps the user build the 3D environment to be simulated and assign dielectric material properties. For example, as presented in Fig. 3, a vehicle can be imported as a set of subcomponents. Users can assign appropriate material properties for each component. VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 86 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19. Das Erstellen und Weitergeben von Kopien dieses PDFs ist nicht zulässig. Fig. 3: Vehicle subcomponents featuring adequate assignment of material properties. 3. “Object Velocities” represents scene dynamics where position and velocity updates are provided at each simulation time step. Such data is usually obtained from any driving simulator or from a set of pre-recorded/measured GPS/IMU data. At each time step, RTR executes a physics-based radar simulation of the scene and returns either the RD data per channel or the raw I/Q channel data (post A/D conversion). Open Simulation Interface To ensure modularity and interchangeability, RTR’s inputs have been adapted to support OSI. Focusing on environment perception and automated driving functions, OSI is an interface specification for models and components of distributed simulation. It defines a generic interface that ensures modularity, interoperability, and integration of simulation framework’s individual components. In addition, OSI was developed to address and align with the emerging standard for communication interfaces of real sensors, ISO 23150 [9]. This will eventually ensure a better correlation between communication interfaces used in both virtual and real worlds. Corresponding to OSI’s message description, the OSI:SensorView message represented in Fig. 4 contains the ground truth data that can be generated by any 3rd party driving simulator. The message includes information about the states of dynamic and static actors.

Scenario Variation Neural Networks (NN) are designed to behave as low bias and high variance machines that can perform extremely well on training data. To generalize such machines to new environments, heterogeneous datasets are essential for the training process. Using Ansys optiSlang, scenario variations were generated based on a predefined set of parameters. As represented in Table 1, a set of three parameters were chosen. Table 1: Scenario Variation Parameters Parameter Description Model Name Describes the 3D geometry of the vehicle. Initial Speed A range between 0 and 80 km/h Driver Behavior Aggressive, Normal, Cautious 1. “Model Name” defines whether a traffic participant is a car, bus, or a motorcycle. It also describes what vehicle model to use, ensuring a large variety of traffic participants within each generated scenario. 2. “Initial Speed” may randomly vary between 0 and 80 km/h.

Integrating and evolving these systems becomes complex. Traditional approaches rely on low-level messaging technologies, delegating much of the message interpretation and information management services to application logic. This complicates system integration because different applications could use inconsistent interpretations and implementations of information-management services, such as detecting component presence, state management, reliability and availability of the information, handling of component failures, etc. Integrating modern systems requires a new, modular network-centric approach that avoids these historic problems by relying on standard APIs and protocols that provide stronger information-management services. For example, many of these systems are heterogeneous, mixing a variety of computer hardware, operating systems, and programming languages. Developers often use Java, .NET, or web-scripting to develop consoles and other GUI-oriented applications, and C or C++ for specialized hardware, device drivers, and performanceor time-critical applications. The end system might mix computers running Windows, Linux, and other operating systems, such as Mac OS X, Android, or real-time operating systems like VxWorks and INTEGRITY. The use of standard APIs and interoperable protocols allows all these systems to be easily integrated and deployed. Today, these systems are typically developed using a service-oriented approach and integrated using standards-based middleware APIs such as DDS, JMS, and CORBA, and protocols such as DDS-RTPS, Web-Services/SOAP, REST/HTTP, AMQP, and CORBA/IIOP. This whitepaper focuses on “real-world” systems, that is, systems that interact with the external physical world and must live within the constraints imposed by real-world physics. Good examples include air-traffic control systems, real-time stock trading, command and control (C2) systems, unmanned vehicles, robotic and vetronics, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. More and more these “real-world” systems are integrated using a Data-Centric PublishSubscribe approach, specifically the programming model defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification. This whitepaper describes the basic characteristics of real-world systems programming, reasons why DDS is the best standard middleware technology to use to integrate these systems, and a set of “best practices” guidelines that should be applied when using DDS to implement these systems. Best-Practices Data-Centric Programming: Using DDS to Integrate Real-World Systems November 2010 4 © 2010 Real-Time Innovations Real-World Systems Programming Real-World systems refer to a class of software systems that operate continuously and interact directly with real-world objects, such as aircraft, trains, stock transactions, weapons, robotic and manufacturing equipment, etc. Unlike systems involving only humans and computers, real-world systems have to live within the constraints imposed by the physics of the external world. Notably, time cannot be slowed, paused, or reversed. The implication is that these systems must be able to handle the information at the pace it arrives at, as well as be robust to changes in the operating environment. In addition to these environmental considerations, the nature of typical real-world applications also places demands on their availability and need to continue operating even in the presence of partial failures. In order to interact with the real world, software must include a reasonable, if simplified, model of the external world. This model typically includes aspects of the “state of the world” relevant to system operations. Here the word “state” is used in the normal sense in software modeling and programming. State summarizes the past inputs to the system from its initial state and contains all the information necessary for a system or program to know how it should react to future events or inputs. Imagine that a new component or application starts and joins a system. The “state of the system” contains the information that this new component needs to acquire before it is ready to start performing its function. A typical component would normally only need access to a subset of that state, the portion that directly affects its operation. For example, in an air-traffic management problem, the relevant aspects of the state of the world might include the current location and trajectory of every aircraft, the flight plans of all flights within a 24-hour window, specific details on each aircraft (type, airline, crew), etc. Once a software component or subsystem is running, it interacts with other components by exposing part of its state, notifying other components when its state changes, and invoking operations on (or sending messages to) other components. Each component reacts to these information exchanges by updating its internal model of the world and using that to perform its necessary actions. Defining a Data Model A data model is simply an organized description of the state of the system. Thus, it includes data types, processes for transferring and updating those types, and methods for accessing the data. It does not typically include functions that can alter the data or (importantly) the application-level logic that affects the data. Governance organizations and system integrators often start their design by designing the system data-model. There are good reasons for this approach: • A data model provides governance across disparate teams and organizations, allowing components developed at different points in time by different organizations to be integrated. This makes it an ideal starting point for a central design or governance authority. Best-Practices Data-Centric Programming: Using DDS to Integrate Real-World Systems November 2010 5 © 2010 Real-Time Innovations • A data model represents the better understood, more invariant aspects of the system. Typically the data model is grounded in the “physics of the system.” That is, it describes the kinds of objects and sensors it manages (like aircraft locations, flight plans, and vehicle positions). The data model is not strongly tied to applicationspecific use cases (e.g., the possible fields in a flight plan are a consequence of the nature of aircraft flight); this makes the data model a good starting point, since the full set of use cases might not be well known in advance or might be the responsibility of a different team. • A data model increases decoupling between systems and components. The data model is grounded in the essential information present in the system and it does not depend so much on the use cases that access the information. For example, an airtraffic control model might include a definition of a “flight plan,” but not whether it is automatically generated using an optimization algorithm, checked for collisions, or altered in mid-flight. Using the data model as the basis for the integration avoids over-constraining the design, leaving it open to allow future evolution and use cases. Contrast this with a design based on defining service invocation APIs which are intimately tied to the details of each service and are likely to change as new use cases are incorporated Example Data Model Imagine designing a simple “chat” application. The underlying Data-Model could be defined to contain four kinds of objects summarized in the table below: Object Kind Key Fields Other Fields Description Person EmailAddress Name, Loc",oceanology,43,unknown

The opportunities afforded by being able to program networks of small, lightweight, low-power, computation- and bandwidth-limited nodes have attracted a large community of researchers and developers. However, the unique set of capabilities offered by the technology produces an exciting but complex design space, which is often difficult to negotiate in an application context. Deploying sensing physical environments produces its own set of challenges, and can push systems into failure modes, thus revealing problems that can be difficult to discover or reproduce in simulation or the laboratory. Sustained efforts in the area of wireless networked sensing over the last 15 years have resulted in a large number of theoretical developments, substantial practical achievements, and a wealth of lessons for the future. It is clear that in order to bridge the gap between (on the one hand) visions of very large scale, autonomous, randomly deployed networks and (on the other) the actual performance of fielded systems, we need to view deployment as an essential component in the process of developing sensor networks: a process that includes hardware and software solutions that serve specific applications and end-user needs. Incorporating deployment into the design process reveals a new and different set of requirements and considerations, whose solutions require innovative thinking, multidisciplinary teams and strong involvement from end-user communities. This special feature uncovers and documents some of the hurdles encountered and solutions offered by experimental scientists when deploying and evaluating wireless sensor networks in situ, in a variety of well specified application scenarios. The papers specifically address issues of generic importance for WSN system designers: (i) data quality, (ii) communications availability and quality, (iii) alternative, low-energy sensing modalities and (iv) system solutions with high end-user added value and cost benefits. The common thread is deployment and deployment evaluation. In particular, satisfaction of application requirements, involvement of the end-user in the design and deployment process, satisfactory system performance and user acceptance are concerns addressed in many of the contributions. The contributions form a valuable set, which help to identify the priorities for research in this burgeoning area: Robust, reliable and efficient data collection in embedded wireless multi-hop networks are essential elements in creating a true deploy-and-forget user experience. Maintaining full connectivity within a WSN, in a real world environment populated by other WSNs, WiFi networks or Bluetooth devices that constitute sources of interference is a key element in any application, but more so for those that are safety-critical, such as disaster response. Awareness of the effects of wireless channel, physical position and line-of-sight on received signal strength in real-world, outdoor environments will shape the design of many outdoor applications. Thus, the quantification of such effects is valuable knowledge for designers. Sensors' failure detection, scalability and commercialization are common challenges in many long-term monitoring applications; transferable solutions are evidenced here in the context of pollutant detection and water quality. Innovative, alternative thinking is often needed to achieve the desired long-lived networks when power-hungry sensors are foreseen components; in some instances, the very problems of wireless technology, such as RF irregularity, can be transformed into advantages. The importance of an iterative design and evaluation methodology—from analysis to simulation to real-life deployment—should be well understood by all WSN developers. The value of this is highlighted in the context of a challenging WPAN video-surveillance application based on a novel Nomadic Access Mechanism. Cost benefits to be drawn from devising a WSN based solution to classic application areas such as surveillance are often a prime motivator for WSN designers; an example is offered here based on the use of intelligent agents for intrusion monitoring. Last but not least, the practicality and usability of the WSN solutions found for novel applications is key to their adoption. This is particularly true when the end-users of the developed technology are medical patients. The importance of feedback, elegant hardware encapsulation and extraction of meaning from data is presented in the context of novel orthopedic rehabilitation aids. Overall, this feature offers wide coverage of most issues encountered in the process of design, implementation and evaluation of deployable WSN systems. We trust that designers and developers of WSN systems will find much work of value, ranging from lessons learned, through solutions to known hurdles, to novel developments that enhance applications.

One of the typical problems is to achieve a seemingly conflicting goal, which is to support timely delivery of real-time flows while improving resource efficiency. Recently, the concept of mixed-criticality (MC) has been widely accepted as useful in addressing the goal for real-time resource management. However, it has not been yet studied well for real-time communication. In this paper, we present the first approach to support MC flow scheduling on switched Ethernet networks leveraging an emerging network architecture, software-defined networking (SDN). Though SDN provides flexible and programmatic ways to control packet forwarding and scheduling, it yet raises several challenges to enable real-time MC flow scheduling on SDN, including: 1) how to handle (i.e., drop or re-prioritize) out-of-mode packets in the middle of the network when the criticality mode changes and 2) how the mode change affects end-to-end transmission delays. Addressing such challenges, we develop MC-SDN that supports real-time MC flow scheduling by extending SDN-enabled switches and OpenFlow protocols. It manages and schedules MC packets in different ways depending on the system criticality mode. To this end, we carefully design the mode change protocol that provides analytic mode change delay bound, and then resolve implementation issues for system architecture. For evaluation, we implement a prototype of MC-SDN on top of Open vSwitch, and integrate it into a real world network testbed as well as a 1/10 autonomous vehicle. Our extensive evaluations with the network testbed and vehicle deployment show that MC-SDN supports MC flow scheduling with minimal delays on forwarding rule updates and it brings a significant improvement in safety in a real-world application scenario.",oceanology,45,unknown

A key next direction is field studies at industry partner sites to examine real-world workplaces. We propose to develop innovative Internet of Things (IoT) techniques that integrate data from building instrumentation, personal device sensors, and self-report interfaces and then deploy this platform in-the-wild to capture rich, longitudinal, ecologically-valid data about the status of office workers and the spaces they occupy. Insights will advance scientific knowledge of how buildings impact wellbeing as well as produce practical implications for building designers and operators. A timely component will explore how covid-19 has temporally or fundamentally changed occupant behaviors and operational decisions (e.g., physical distancing desks and ventilation settings that reduce pathogen spread). Overall, our proposed research has the potential to transform the industry’s thinking on how built environments can be designed, operated, and experienced. Hybrid Physical-Digital Spaces: Transforming the Design, Operation, and Experience of Built Environments to Promote Health and Wellbeing Problem and Significance Considering that people in the U.S. spend 87% of their time in indoor spaces , we assert that 1 buildings are powerful yet underleveraged loci for promoting human wellbeing. Imagine an intelligent office that could adapt soundscape systems to manage noise in open floor plans, optimize space reservation or utilization to foster collaborations and save energy, or provide digital information displays that promote employee connectedness and physical activity. Towards actualizing our vision of such hybrid physical-digital spaces, our proposal strives to develop, apply, and evaluate novel scientific and engineering approaches that will transform the industry’s thinking around how built environments can be designed, operated, and experienced. Increasingly, hypotheses suggest that built features of indoor environments (e.g., lighting, materials, and ventilation) have substantial impacts on occupants (e.g., employee recruitment and retention, absenteeism, cognition, creativity, productivity, social interactions, physical activity and health, and psychological wellbeing). In turn, these individual outcomes also drive pivotal organizational outcomes such as product innovation, workforce diversity, employee turnover, market share, and profitability. Examples illustrate how building interventions can have huge impacts : enhancing employee exposure to daylight can save businesses ~$2,000/yr per capita 2 , better air quality can raise cognitive scores of workers by 101% 3 , and increasing indoor access to biophilic elements could recoup $23 billion considering 10% of workplace absenteeism (a $226 billion dollar problem) is attributable to architecture that inadequately connects to nature 4 . However, few of these hypotheses have been tested at scale, over time, and in real world conditions . Instead, most prior efforts are small sample, short-term correlational studies based on potentially biased and sparse self-reported data. A more rigorous, scientific, and human-centered approach to study and engineer buildings that promote wellbeing can have major implications at individual, organizational, and societal levels (see Figure 1), offering both foundational theoretical knowledge as well as practical strategies for building designers and operators. Figure 1. Relations among building features and human outcomes at various levels. Further, “smart buildings” today typically focus on basic sensing and control for energy savings, thermal comfort, and security. Connecting to CIFE’s Vision for the Future of Building Users, we argue buildings of the future can go beyond such bottom line outcomes to be more interactive and human-centered: aware of and responsive to occupants’ cognitive, mental, and physical feelings and needs, while respecting privacy and promoting positive indoor experiences . 1 Klepeis, et al., 2001; 2 Heschong & Mahone, 2003; 3 Allen et al., 2016; 4 Elzeyadi, 2011. <Landay-Billington> < Hybrid Physical-Digital Spaces> 1 Theoretical and Practical Points of Departure It is imperative to increase understanding of exactly what built attributes have what impacts and on whom, in a scalable, longitudinal, and inclusive manner. Thus through technology-driven assessment and hybrid physical-digital interventions, we aim to (a) fundamentally advance the science on how built environments impact human wellbeing and, in turn, (b) generate guidelines that can revolutionize the way spaces are designed, operated, and experienced . Our current scope focuses on office spaces and workers; though an overarching goal is for our developed approaches and insights to establish a foundation that enables future research with additional populations and environments (e.g., physicians and patients in clinical settings, students and teachers in classrooms, and traditionally marginalized shift and temporary workers). In particular, our reusable platform will help others study this wider range of buildings and occupants; and combining these approaches with emerging endeavors such as biophilic design and precision interventions provides a novel opportunity to not only more deeply investigate but also address long-running public health challenges and systemic inequities facing society. In these ways, we hope to positively impact a broad cross-section of stakeholders at individual, organizational, and institutional levels. Moreover, this project will support interdisciplinary fertilization across engineering, computing, psychology, law, and medicine . Research Methods and Work Plan Our research agenda is to support the design and operation of built facilities that augment human capabilities and wellbeing — and have a fundamental positive change on the way indoor spaces are experienced by the people that occupy them. By introducing intelligent systems capable of gathering and interpreting building and occupant data as well as delivering adaptive interventions in response, novel roles will also emerge for managing buildings and the activities that take place inside them. To achieve these goals, our research will comprise three main activities: 1. Developing an extensible and secure data collection and machine learning platform . A key aim of this research is scientifically examining how built spaces impact human wellbeing. To pursue this investigation and develop methods that enable buildings to be more aware of occupants’ states and needs, we have been developing pattern detection software that integrates data from (a) personal devices (smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers), (b) building instrumentation or portable environmental sensors (light levels, air quality), and (c) experience sampling interfaces that prompt occupants for subjective information through quick, validated self-report techniques. Figure 2 illustrates examples of these assessment components. This work involves addressing a number of technical challenges, such as selecting sampling rates and window sizes to maximize efficiency, developing methods for analyzing asynchronous and sparse sensor data, and developing privacy-sensitive feature engineering strategies for detecting and predicting wellbeing outcomes of interest. We also plan to package our platform as a reusable toolkit that can be applied by other researchers and building operators. This work is ongoing and a basic version will be ready by summer. Once development is complete, CIFE support would allow us to move onto the next critical phase: moving out of the lab and into the field. <Landay-Billington> < Hybrid Physical-Digital Spaces> 2 Figure 2. Platform to integrate data from personal devices, building sensors, and subjective self-report. 2. Deploying the platform through a mixed-method study with industry partners . The next step in our research is to deploy this platform at field sites in partnership with View, Inc. (specifically, at TIAA offices in Manhattan, this summer/fall) to capture rich, longitudinal, ecologically-valid data about behavioral, psychological, and physiological states of occupants and their everyday work environments. Our plan is to recruit a sample of approximately 150 employees for a period of 18 weeks, which will involve a baseline phase followed by systematic variation of built features (Views/No Views, Plants/No Plants, and Diversity/No Diversity in artwork) and measurement of indicators hypothesized to promote both personal wellbeing and organizational performance, based on the literature and our formative online and lab studies, described below. In combination with the engineering-focused activities to implement and install the platform, deployment will occur in tandem with ethnographic work (e.g., observations, interviews, and surveys) to manually validate reliability of the system’s automated inferences as well as gain a more qualitative portrait of occupant experiences in various spaces. Privacy-centric engagements will additionally investigate stakeholders’ attitudes regarding the capture of various types of information to derive implications about informed consent and personal data management. Along similar lines, it will be critical to responsibly manage captured data, especially potentially sensitive and exploitable data about wellness or performance. Therefore all studies will be conducted with oversight and approval from the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB). In addition to obtaining participants’ informed consent, we will also design sensor and data collection mechanisms to use an opt-in model, including partial participation. Our data management systems can also allow individuals to view and delete their personal data, including if purging is desired in the event of study withdrawal.

WSNs have therefore been a major focus of research over the past 20 years. While WSNs offer a persuasive solution for accurate real-time sensing of the physical world, they are yet to be as ubiquitous as originally predicted when the technology was first envisaged. Technical difficulties exist which have inhibited the anticipated uptake in WSN technologies. The most challenging of these have been identified as system reliability, battery lifetime, maintenance requirements, node size and ease of use. Over the past decade, the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) group at the Tyndall National Institute, has been at the forefront of driving the vision of ubiquitously deployed, extended lifetime, low power consumption embedded systems providing information rich data streams wirelessly in (close to) real-time. In this time, the WSN group has developed multiple novel, first of kind, wireless multi-sensor systems and deployed these in the world around us, overcoming the technical challenges associated with ensuring robust and reliable long-term data sets from our environment. This work is focused on investigating and addressing these challenges through the development of the new technologies and system integration methodologies required to facilitate and implement WSNs and validate these in real deployments. Specifically, discussed are the development and deployment of novel WSN systems in the built environment, environmental monitoring and fitness and health monitoring systems.The key research challenges identified and discussed are:a)The development of resource-constrained, extremely low power consumption systems incorporating energy-efficient hardware and software algorithms.b)The development of highly reliable extremely long duration deployments which through the use of appropriate energy harvesting solutions facilitate (near) zero maintenance sensor networks.c)The development of low power consumption miniaturized wearable microsysteThe development of technologies to address these challenges in terms of cost, size, power consumption and reliability which need to be tested and validated in real world deployments of wireless sensing systems is discussed.

Model accuracy, limited data for calibration, and simulation assumptions limit the validity of evaluation results. One alternative approach is to use emerging hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing methods. HIL test environments enable physical test vehicles to interact with virtual vehicles from traffic simulation models, providing an evaluation environment that can replicate deployment conditions at early stages of CAV technology implementation without incurring excessive costs related to large field tests. In this study, a HIL testing system for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) CAV applications is developed. The involved software and hardware includes a physical CAV controlled in real time, a traffic signal controller, communication devices, and a traffic simulator (VISSIM). Such HIL systems increase validity by considering the physical vehicle’s trajectories—which are constrained by real-world factors such as GPS accuracy, communication delay, and vehicle dynamics—in a simulated traffic environment. The developed HIL system is applied to test a representative early deployment CAV application: queue-aware signalized intersection approach and departure (Q-SIAD). The Q-SIAD algorithm generates recommended speed profiles based on the vehicle’s status, signal phase and timing (SPaT), downstream queue length, and system constraints and parameters (e.g., maximum acceleration and deceleration). The algorithm also considers the status of other vehicles in designing the speed profiles. The experiment successfully demonstrated this functionality with one test CAV driving through one intersection controlled by a fixed-timing traffic signal under various simulated traffic conditions.",oceanology,49,not included

Traditional software diversity or code randomization techniques diversify the code memory layout and make it difficult for potential attackers to pinpoint the precise location of the target vulnerability. However, those approaches may not be sufficient enough for the new micro architecture attacks (e.g., Spectre). While some architecture researchers have proposed using diverse ISA configurations to defeat code injection or code reuse attacks, most of these works remain in the simulation stage due to legal, licensing, and verification costs involved in bringing a heterogeneous chip design into physical hardware [39]. In this paper, we report our on-going work of HeterSec, a framework to secure applications utilizing real world heterogeneous ISA machines. HeterSec runs on top of the commodity x86_64 and ARM64 machines. It gives the process the ability to dynamically select its underlying ISA environment. Therefore, the protected process would hide the vulnerable targets with the diversified instruction set, or would detect the abnormal behavior by comparing the execution results step-by-step from multiple ISA-diversified instances. To demonstrate the effectiveness of such software framework, we implemented HeterSec on Linux and showed its deployability by running it on a x86_64 and ARM64machine pair, connected using InfiniBand. We then conduct two case studies with HeterSec. In the first case, we timely randomize the process execution path across the ISA, which achieves similar security guarantees as the existing architecture based solutions. In the second case, we implement a multi-ISA based multi-version execution (MVX) system, providing a stronger security guarantee than current homogeneousISA MVX designs.",oceanology,50,unknown

The goal of this approach is to improve computational capabilities in Mechanical Engineering and long-term retention rates with a single broad emphasis. Major and minor changes were implemented in the course, from specific day to day in-class activities to the addition of laboratory sessions to replace traditional classroom lecture. These laboratories of no more than fifteen students were delivered by Learning Assistants, which were upper-level undergraduate peer educators. To evaluate proficiency, a MATLAB post-test was delivered to students who were instructed through lecture only (“Lecture”) and those who were instructed with the above changes (“Active”). A survey was also provided upon completion of the course to the Active group for student reflection on their perceived software capability and the usefulness of approaches. Post-test results suggest that the Active group was more proficient in MATLAB than the Lecture group. Survey results suggest that the Active group recognize they had not achieved expert use of the software but that they were likely to use it throughout their careers and that all approaches were useful, in particular the use of Learning Assistants. Future longterm retention statistics will shed light on the possible effectiveness of this approach, which are currently unavailable. Introduction Colorado State University has a total student enrollment in excess of 33,000. As a land grant university, the historic mission of the institution is to provide students with an education in practical fields such as agriculture and engineering. The College of Engineering has a growing student cohort, with an increase from ~450 first-year students Fall 2010 to ~600 students Fall 2015 [1]. However, persistence and graduation rates have remained fairly steady over the last fifteen years. The current six year persistence rate within the college is only ~45% and the six year graduation rate within the college is similar at ~43%. Many students do not remain within the college for even a full year, as the second fall persistence rate is only 70-75% [1]. These data show a significant portion of enrolled first-year engineering students do not remain within the program long enough to be exposed to foundational engineering content, which starts in the sophomore year with engineering specific courses. A current goal of the college is to improve these retention statistics. Additionally, many students do not develop the necessary software skills required to use computational tools such as MATLAB, which are integral to success in the curriculum. Students who do not develop these skills during introductory coursework must “catch up” in later courses, where the technical content is more challenging. We hypothesize this can lead to unpreparedness for challenging content or careers as an engineer and can negatively impact academic standing, leading to decreased retention. Thus, the goals of this work were to 1) improve retention rates for first-year engineering students, specifically mechanical engineering, and 2) improve computational and software skills of first-year students, specifically MATLAB and Microsoft Excel. MATLAB is a common computational package which can be used for a broad range of engineering problems throughout a curriculum [2]. However, learning Excel and MATLAB through lecture is challenging, as these tools are best understood through utilization, not observation [3]. MATLAB and other computational tools are often taught in classrooms with computational equipment, however this is can be a challenge with a large classroom [4]. Some have utilized computer based tutorials which students can complete on their own time [5], while others implemented a large scale deployment of personal computers equipped with MATLAB and other software [6]. Additionally, the use of peer-educators can be an effective approach to facilitating MATLAB development [7]. Thus, we have chosen to employ an approach which utilizes an active environment to learn MATLAB and other introductory content through the use of laboratory sessions and peer-educators, in this case the Learning Assistant model [8]. Similar to previous approaches, we have utilized classroom lectures, hands on in-class activities, and laboratory sessions [9]. The Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Course (MECH 103) was developed to provide students with an overview of the mechanical engineering discipline and as an introduction to the computational packages MATALB [10] and Microsoft Excel. The course consists of between 140 and 250 first-year students and was previously delivered using traditional lecture. While this approach was most efficient for a single instructor due to the enrollment size, this resulted in a static learning environment for a course which should excite students about mechanical engineering and provide foundational technical skills. The overall approach to this work was to thus create an active environment for students within the course, which had an enrollment of 145 students for the Fall 2016 semester. The rationale to this approach was that by providing students with hands-on experiences working with mechanical engineering problems and computational software, the understanding of course content will improve [11,12] whereby improving retention [13]. While some immediate test and survey data were acquired and are shown in this work, it is important to note that the true impact on retention is not currently recognizable and will require future analysis. In-Class Sessions Class sessions were varied throughout the semester and the week, as they typically included lectured course material, guest lectures or panels, and activities. The course met Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9-9:50 AM in a large lecture hall with individual stadium seating. Friday lecture was often cancelled and this time was spent in weekly laboratory sessions instead, which are outlined in the next section. Monday class time was assigned to covering course content through lecture, teamwork activities, and in class problems. The content of the course included general introductory material such as teamwork, communication, and design, commonly used units and unit conversions, mathematical models and systems, and an introduction to Microsoft Excel and MATLAB. Active engagement in the class included a teamwork design problem, requiring students to break into groups of three. Due to the theater seating layout of the classroom, groups of four or more made successful teamwork and communication difficult. Each group of students were provided one piece of 8.5” x 11” blank printer paper, one paperclip, and two pieces of scotch tape. The design problem was simple: build the tallest free standing structure possible using only the given materials. This was an inexpensive and simple approach to teamwork design activity. In place of a lecture or even a discussion on how to use design techniques for a simple problem such as this, students were able to actively engage in this process despite the difficulties of class size and layout. While students typically have an excellent understanding of units such as a pound (lb), their physical understanding of units such as a Joule or Watt are less developed within the context of everyday life. To provide students with a meaningful representation of energy (Joule) and power (Watt), they were provided a common object – in this case a softball – and asked to calculate how high they would have to raise the object to exert one Joule of energy – in this case roughly a foot and a half. While simple and inexpensive, this activity provided students with useful knowledge they can apply without a calculator and helps them relate coursework to the real world. For example, if they can place a Joule into real-world context, they could then answer the question “Can I launch a rocket into space using a thousand Joules?”. Wednesday lecture sessions were commonly used for guest lecturers and panels. These class sessions included the College of Engineering Dean, faculty members and graduate students in mechanical engineering, industry panelists, entrepreneurs and small business owners, and an interactive teamwork theatre troupe. The goal of these sessions was to provide students with a broad overview of different disciplines within mechanical engineering and what skills are necessary to succeed in various professional roles. While emphasizing an active learning environment is inherently difficult with each and every guest, student engagement was addressed by delivering variability in all of the presentations and strongly encouraging students to ask questions. For example, the theater troupe was an interactive experience where students were able to act as a team member within a group that mocked to show a diverse team struggling with communication. This session involved humor, discussion, and lively responses from students in place of a traditional static lecture. Laboratory Sessions In place of Friday lecture, students were asked to attend laboratory sessions for one hour [14,3]. A total of eleven sessions were provided throughout the week to accommodate all schedules. Sessions included one instructor, 13-16 students, and were held in laboratories with individual workstations with Microsoft Excel and MATLAB software. Laboratory instructors included a Graduate Teaching Fellow and Undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs). Laboratory sessions involved a short (<5 minutes) lecture briefly reviewing content from class before students began working on assigned problems. These problems implemented course content such as the use of Excel or MATLAB to analyze and display data through real-world applications.

To reduce the possibility of such unanticipated failures, the system must be monitored for tell-tale symptoms of degradation that are suggestive of imminent failure. In this work, we introduce a novel time series analysis technique that allows the decomposition of the time series into trend and fluctuation components, providing the monitoring software with actionable information about the changes of the system's behavior over time. We analyze the underlying problem and formulate it to a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem that can be solved with existing QP-solvers. However, when the profiling resolution is high, as generally required by real-world applications, such a decomposition becomes intractable to general QP-solvers. To speed up the problem solving, we further transform the problem and present a novel QP formulation, Non-negative QP, for the problem and demonstrate a tractable solution that bypasses the use of slow general QP-solvers. We demonstrate our ideas on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that our method allows us to accurately extract the degradation phenomenon of time series. We further demonstrate the generality of our ideas by applying them beyond classic machine prognostics to problems in identifying the influence of news events on currency exchange rates and stock prices. We fully implement our profiling system and deploy it into several physical systems, such as chemical plants and nuclear power plants, and it greatly helps detect the degradation phenomenon, and diagnose the corresponding components.",oceanology,54,unknown

The main contributions are a specification of our fully automated learning environment and a detailed empirical comparison of four different machine learning algorithms for learning quadrupedal locomotion. The resulting learned walk is considerably faster than all previously reported hand-coded walks for the same robot platform. Introduction The ability to deploy a fully autonomous robot in an unstructured, dynamic environment (the proverbial real world) over an extended period of time remains an open challenge in the field of robotics. Considerable progress is being made towards many components of this task including physical agility, power management, and on-board sensor technology. One such component that has drawn considerable interest recently is the ability for a robot to autonomously learn to improve its own performance (Ng et al. 2004; Bagnell & Schneider 2001; Zhang & Vadakkepat 2003). Despite this interest, considerable work remains due to the di fficulties associated with machine learning in the real world . Compared to other machine learning scenarios such as classification or action learning in simulation, learning o n physical robots presents several formidable challenges, i ncluding the following. Sparse Training Data: It is often prohibitively difficult to generate large amounts of data due to the maintenance required on robots, such as battery changes, hardware repairs, and, usually, constant human supervision. Thus, learning methods designed for physical robots must be effective with small amounts of data. Dynamical Complexity: The dynamics of many robotic control tasks are too complex for faithful simulation to be possible. Furthermore, robots are inherently situated in an unstructured environment with unpredictable sensor and actuator noise, namely the real world. Thus, even when off-line simulation is possible, it can never be fully reflective of the target environment. In this paper, we overcome these challenges for one concrete complex robot task, namely legged locomotion. Using a commercially available quadruped robot, we fully automate the training process (other than battery changes) and Copyright c © 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The resulting learned walk is considerably faster than all previously reported hand-cod ed walks for the same robot platform. This paper contributes both a specification of our fully automated learning environment and a detailed empirical comparison of four different machine learning algorithms for learning quadrupedal locomotion. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the parameterized walk which our learning process seeks to optimize. We then specify our four learning approaches, and follow with detailed empirical results. We close with a discussion of their implications and possible avenues for future work. A Parameterized Walk The Sony Aibo ERS-210A is a commercially available robot that is equipped with a color CMOS camera and an optional ethernet card that can be used for wireless communication. The Aibo is a quadruped robot, and has three degrees of freedom in each of its four legs (Sony 2004). At the lowest level, the Aibo’s gait is determined by a series of joint positions for the three joints in each of its leg s. An early attempt to develop a gait by Hornby et al. (1999) involved using a genetic algorithm to learn a set of lowlevel parameters that described joint velocities and body p osition.1 More recent attempts to develop gaits for the Aibo have involved adopting a higher-level representation that deals with the trajectories of the Aibo’s four feet through three-dimensional space. An inverse kinematics calculati on is then used to convert these trajectories into joint angles . Among higher-level approaches, most of the differences between gaits that have been developed for the Aibo stem from the shape of the loci through which the feet pass and the exact parameterizations of those loci. For example, a team from the University of New South Wales achieved the fastest known hand-tuned gait using the high-level approach described above with trapezoidal loci. They subsequently generated an even faster walk via learning (Kim & Uther 2003). A team from Germany created a flexible gait implementation that allows them to use a variety of different shapes of loci (Rofer et al. 2003), and the team from the University of Newcastle was able to generate highvelocity gaits using a genetic algorithm and loci of arbitra ry shape (Quinlan, Chalup, & Middleton 2003). Our team (UT Austin Villa, Stone t al. 2004) first approached the gait optimization problem by hand-tuning Developed on an earlier version of the Aibo. a gait described by half-elliptical loci. This gait performed comparably to those of other teams participating in RoboCup 2003. The work reported in this paper uses the hand-tuned UT Austin Villa walk as a starting point for learning. Figure 1 compares the reported speeds of the gaits mentioned above, both hand-tuned and learned, including that of our starting point, the UT Austin Villa walk. The latter walk is described fully in a team technical report (Stone et al. 2004). The remainder of this section describes those details of the UT Austin Villa walk that are important to understand for the purposes of this paper.

The half-elliptical locus used by our team is shown in Figure 2. By instructing each foot to move through a locus of this shape, with each pair of diagonally opposite legs in phase with each other and perfectly out of phase with the other two (a gait known as a trot), we enable the Aibo to walk. Four parameters define this elliptical locus: 1. The length of the ellipse; 2. The height of the ellipse; 3. The position of the ellipse on the x axis; and 4.

To help to de-risk the system integration, and to assist in the design process, computer simulation is an accepted and widely-adopted tool. However, in a simulation-only environment, many real-world issues such as noise, randomness of event timings, and hardware design issues are not well explored. In addition, there are limits on the size and fidelity of system which can be simulated, due to the required computational intensity, and because control systems for devices often contain software which is proprietary and cannot be modelled accurately. Physical Hardware in the Loop Simulation provides an interim stage between purely computer-based simulation, and real device deployment. Part of the power system (or “Smart Grid”) is simulated, but specific components are implemented in actual hardware. The hardware may consist of instrumentation, relays or controllers, carrying no primary current. Such testing is termed “Secondary Hardware-in-the-Loop”, as the signals exchanged between the simulation and hardware consist only of measurements and control values. A more advanced environment is created where primary power flow is exchanged with the hardware. This is termed “Primary Hardware-in-the-Loop” or “Power Hardware-in-the-Loop” testing. In addition to measurement and control signals being exchanged with the simulation, an interface is required at which primary power is exchanged between the simulation and the hardware, at the voltage and current levels suitable for the hardware under test. Creation of such environments is complex, but allows steady-state, dynamic, and worst-case scenarios to be re-created in a controlled environment. Therefore hardware-in-the-loop testing offers a cheaper, safer, faster and more comprehensive de-risking process than trying the hardware for the first time on a real network. The complexity and interconnected nature of the Smart Grid means that such Hardware in the Loop based testing is becoming even more critical to understanding the behaviour of systems and schemes, and consequently the safe and secure introduction of new technologies.",oceanology,56,unknown

A joint effort from the automobile industry, transportation industry, and government offices is driving the adoption of this technology to build intelligent transportation systems that consist of smart vehicles. This study attempts to improve the reliability and efficiency of vehicular networking. The study assumes the context of platooning applications, but the contributions of this study can be applied to other vehicular applications as well. There are two contributions in this study. First, a wireless emulator is designed and implemented to emulate IEEE 802.11 networks in real-time using the Ethernet infrastructure. The emulator replaces the MAC layer and physical layer of IEEE 802.11 networking stack with a real-time CSMA/CA model, thus reduces the cost of experiments. It provides upper layers the same interfaces as on a real device. As a result, the testing targets in the emulation are real-world software components as opposed to simulation scripts in a discrete event simulator. These software components can be routing protocols, transport protocols, or applications, and are the same code that can be deployed in the real world. Second, an Interframe Compression Transmission Layer is designed and implemented, to provide efficient transmission of periodical messages in vehicular environments. The transmission layer compresses the difference between frames instead of frames themselves, and reduces bandwidth consumption significantly. To improve the behaviors of the transmission layer under different scenarios and configurations studied, an adaptive version of the algorithm is designed, which achieves more than 50% in reduction of bandwidth consumption using real-world platooning data trace. With lower bandwidth consumption, delivery ratio is vastly improved in congested networking environments.",oceanology,60,unknown

Numerous experiments have recently demonstrated that channel-based key establishment (CBKE) is a promising alternative to well-known symmetric/asymmetric approaches. Their run-times for establishing a symmetric key suggest that such methods are highly suitable for real-world applications that operate in a dynamic mobile environment with peer-to-peer association. CBKE is a new paradigm for generating shared secret keys. The approach is based on the estimation of the wireless transmission channel by both the sender and receiver, where the shared secret key is derived from channel parameters. The commonness of the randomness of the secret key relies on the principle of channel reciprocity. Specifically, this means that the channel from Alice to Bob is the same than the channel from Bob to Alice. This symmetry of practical channels is usually sufficiently high, as well as its entropy of spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics. Security is given if an attacker’s distance to the two communicating nodes is high enough, so that the observed channel parameters to each node are uncorrelated and independent from each other. Typically, in real environments this is given if the distance is greater than about half of the carrier wavelength. For instance, for the frequency used in 2.4 GHz WiFi, this translates to a distance of 6.25 cm. So far, high usability and dynamic key management are very difficult to achieve for wireless devices, which operate under strict resource constraints. CBKE has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of securing small embedded devices, and hence make mass production and deployment more viable. Until now, no research has addressed the requirements for performance evaluation of real-world implementations of CBKE systems. We present a wireless CBKE security system built with standard components, e.g., quantization scheme and error correction codes, presented in recent publications. We introduce necessary implementation properties and requirements of CBKE systems. In order to validate the performance of the key generation algorithms, we define a set of metrics. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation on an ARM-Cortex M3 microcontroller to demonstrate the practical feasibility of channel-based key estimation using current embedded hardware.

For this purpose, we distinguish between physical RGs and software RGs, which can be further subdivided into cryptographically secure and insecure RGs. Physical RGs covered by our study are the hardware generator PRG310-4 and /dev/random as implemented in the Linux kernel. Since /dev/random is fed by system events, we analyze both an idle lab environment and a server hosting several virtual machines. As examples for cryptographically secure RGs our analysis compares the RSA generator and the Blum-Blum-Shub generator, both for 3000-bit moduli. Additionally, we compare them to the Nisan-Wigderson construction with suitably selected parameters. We include two cryptographically insecure RGs, namely a linear congruential generator (LCG) and the Littlewood generator. In order to obtain repeatable and comparable results, our implementations of the software RGs were all run on the same machine and produced 512 kB of output each, using AES post-processed output of the generator PRG310-4 as source for random seed bits. We compare the results in terms of byte entropy and throughput excluding initialization. For further statistical analysis — not shown in the table — we apply the NIST test suite on the outputs.

We deployed this MOOC three times with a total enrollment of over 100,000 students. If MOOCs are truly going to transform engineering education, then they must be able to deliver classes with laboratory components. Our offering goes a long way in unraveling the perceived complexities in delivering a laboratory experience to thousands of students from around the globe. We believe the techniques developed in this class will significantly transform the MOOC environment. Effective education requires students to learn by doing. In the traditional academic setting this active learning is achieved through a lab component. Translating this to the online environment is a non-trivial task that required several important factors to come together. First, we have significant support from industrial partners ARM Inc. [1] and Texas Instruments [2]. Second, the massive growth of embedded microcontrollers has made the availability of lost-cost development platforms feasible. Third, we have assembled a team with the passion, patience, and experience of delivering quality lab experiences to large classes. Fourth, online tools now exist that allow students to interact and support each other. We used edX for the delivery of videos, interactive animations, text, and quizzes [3]. We used Piazza [4] for discussion boards and Zyante [5] for a programming reference. We partnered with element-14 [6], Digi-Key [7], and Mouser [8] to make the lab kit available and low-cost. Even though there was a $40-$70 cost to purchase the lab kit, the course completion numbers were slightly better than a typical MOOC. 7.3% of the students completed enough of the class to receive a certificate. Students completing end of the course surveys report a 95% overall satisfaction. Demographics show a world-wide reach with India, US, and Egypt being the countries with the most students. In this paper we will present best practices, successes and limitations of teaching a substantial lab across the globe. Background An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with a computer, hidden inside, to serve a single dedicated purpose [9-11]. There are over 50 billion processors based on the ARM architecture delivered into products, and most of these computers are single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system. Embedded systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges, our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers. Review Other online classes have delivered laboratory experiences. Hesselink at Stanford University developed iLabs as a means to deliver science experiments to online learning. Their lab-in-a-box involves simulations and animations [12]. O’Malley et al. from the University of Manchester developed a Chemistry MOOC with a lab component using virtual labs and simulations [13-14]. University of Washington presented a hardware/software MOOC on Coursera [15]. This course is primarily a programming class without graded physical labs. Ferri et al. from Georgia Institute of Technology created a MOOC for linear circuits [16]. This class had activities to perform with NI’s myDAC, but graded lab circuits were not part of the online experience. Connor, and Huettel at Duke created a Virtual Community of Practice for electric circuits [17]. Cherner et al. created a virtual multifunctional X-Ray diffractometer for teaching science and engineering [18]. Saterbak et al. at Rice University developed online materials to teach freshman design, with the goal to free-up class time for more interactive learning experiences [19]. Harris from University of California at Irvine has a six-course sequence on Introduction to the Internet of Things and Embedded Systems where students build actual embedded devices [20]. Grading for this course uses peer assessment. Lee et al. at Berkeley developed an introduction to embedded systems MOOC with laboratory exercises. The lab itself was a robotic controller in a virtual laboratory environment. Completion of the labs themselves does have an automatic grading component based on the student’s written software [21-22]. All this work emphasizes the need for hands on learning. Pedagogy The overall educational objective of this class is to allow students to discover how computers interact with the environment. The class provides hands-on experiences of how an embedded system could be used to solve problems. The focus of this introductory course is understanding and analysis rather than design, where students learn new techniques by doing them. We feel we have solved the dilemma in learning a laboratory-based topic like embedded systems, where there is a tremendous volume of details that first must be learned before hardware and software systems can be designed. The approach taken in this course is to learn by doing in a bottom-up fashion. One of the advantages of a bottom-up approach to learning is that the student begins by mastering simple concepts. Once the student truly understands simple concepts, he or she can embark on the creative process of design, which involves putting the pieces together to create a more complex system. True creativity involves solving complex problems using effective combinations of simple components. Embedded systems afford an effective platform to teach new engineers how to program for three reasons. First, there is no operating system. Thus, in a bottom-up fashion the student can see, write, and understand all software running on a system that actually does something. Second, embedded systems involve real input/output that is easy for the student to touch, hear, and see. Many engineering students struggle with abstraction. We believe many students learn effectively by using their sense of touch, hearing and sight to first understand and internalize difficult concepts, and then they will be able to develop and appreciate abstractions. Third, embedded systems are employed in many everyday products, motivating students to see firsthand, how engineering processes can be applied in the real world. This course is intended for beginning college students with some knowledge of electricity as would have been taught in an introductory college physics class. Secondly, it is expected students will have some basic knowledge of programming and logic design. No specific language will be assumed as prior knowledge but this class could be taken as their second programming class. We hoped experienced engineers could also use this course to train or retrain in the field of embedded systems. Learning objectives of the course Although the students are engaged with a fun and rewarding lab experience, our educational pedagogy is centered on fundamental learning objectives. After the successful conclusion of this class, students should be able to understand the basic components of a computer, write C language programs that perform input/output interfacing, implement simple data structures, manipulate numbers in multiple formats, and understand how software uses global memory to store permanent information and the stack to store temporary information. Our goal is for students to learn these concepts: 0) How the computer stores and manipulates data; 1) Embedded systems using modular design and abstraction; 2) Design tools like requirements documents, data flow graphs, and call graphs; 3) C programming: considering both function and style; 4) Debugging and verification using a simulator and the real microcontroller; 5) Debugging tools like voltmeters, oscilloscopes, and logic analyzers; 6) How to input/output using switches, LEDs, DACs, ADCs, and serial ports; 7) Implementation of an I/O driver, multithreaded programming, and interrupts; 8) Analog to digital conversion (ADC), periodic sampling, and the Nyquist Theorem; 9) Stepper motors, brushed DC motors, and simple digital controllers; 10) Digital to analog conversion (DAC), used to make simple sounds; 11) Simple distributed systems that connect two microcontrollers; 12) Internet of things, connecting the embedded system to the internet; 13) System-level design that combine multiple components together. Laboratory Kit Active learning requires a platform for the student to learn by doing. Figure 1 shows the components of the basic lab kit. There are two difficulties with a physical lab kit deployed in a world-wide open classroom environment. The first problem is availability of components. We partnered with companies and distributors six months in advance of the course launch to guarantee availability. The companies wanted us to specify the number of students who would buy the kit. In this regard, we were very lucky. Six months prior to our first launch, we estimated 2000 people would register for the class and 1000 would buy the kit. In turns out Texas Instruments produced 10,000 microcontroller boards just in case. Much to our surprise 40,000 people registered and we estimate 11,000 purchased the kit during this first delivery of the course. The second solution to the problem of availability was to have three world-wide distributors (element-14, Mouser, and Digi-Key). Working with these distributors, we created one-click landing pages for students to buy the kit. Furthermore, for each component in the kit (other than the microcontroller board), we had three or more possible parts. The third solution was to design the course with flexible deadlines and pathways. Each lab had a simulation and a real-board requirement. Students who were waiting for the parts to be shipped could proceed with ",oceanology,62,unknown

The project was developed by students and demonstrates new ideas and teamwork. This project was successfully completed and has been developed, implemented and assessed. Topics covered are: how to build a smart gird by utilizing computer application software tools, design, simulation, and diagnoses of electrical distribution systems. All the real world components in electrical distribution network such as residential, commercial and industrial building are modeled in this project. Background The purpose of this project is to design and implement a small scale electric power network by a team of seven students, supervised by a faculty member. The students’ background is in electrical engineering with emphasis in electric power system. The students conducted a study in the field of Smart Grid technologies for history and background information. This work led to designing and implementing a small model of a smart gird power distribution network. The power grid represents the real world aspirations of both government and private industry geared toward building a more reliable, responsive, and overall efficient network of residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Since the concept of a smart grid is very vague, students chose to implement a time tested and proven aspect of such technology known as smart meters. The smart meter is a wireless device connected to every house, industrial and commercial buildings to provide essential feedback in real time to the power companies. This feedback could be in the form of a fault occurring at that said location, or illegal energy usage. This feedback in real time is very useful to the power companies, given the fact that most rely on feedback via a phone call from the consumer before they know whether or not there is a fault in the system. Another purpose of implementing the grid was to simulate metering technology at the residential, industrial and commercial level. These meters would send data to a computer which is a simulated control room in order to read where certain faults occur in the system. In turn one could control which areas of the grid would be supplying the power. This represents a simulation of the power company’s ability to read and send vital information throughout the grid, thus improving the responsiveness and reliability of the network. Figure 1 illustrates the completed model after it was built and during testing. The lifecycle of this project was implemented in three different phases and started in September of 2009 and it was completed in May of 2010. Planning and analysis was completed in phase I, design and implementation in phase II, and documentation and students’ assessment in phase III. Figure 1. A model of smart grid in electrical distribution system Phase I: Planning and Analysis Initially, each team member worked on individual research on the concepts of smart grid its purpose. Later on, a decision was made as to what the team wanted to demonstrate with the project. The decision was made to show specifically how smart meters would work and help in fault detection as well as saving money by removing the need for meter readers to read the power meters every month. A project leader was elected by the team members to coordinate the team work. Meetings were then set up by the project leader, to brainstorm on how the actual implementation was going to be planned. Microsoft Project software was very instrumental to organize the work of the team. Tasks were assigned with specific due dates to keep the project on schedule and under budget. Requirements Since this project was spread over three quarters, students had many deadlines and task that had to be met in order to have a successful project. There were three phases to this project, research, background study and planning during the 1 quarter, design and building during the 2 quarter and the final stage of testing and troubleshooting during the 3 quarter along with final oral presentation, simulation documentation and assessment of the project. The students made documents and recorded each steps of the project down to each task and timeline by using Microsoft Project software. The project advisor coordinated the project steps and students were required to present a weekly progress report. This step insured that the project was moving smooth and on the track. The group was divided into two teams, one in software teams which consisted of two members and a hardware team which consisted of other five group members. The software team was in charge of all the coding and GUI implementation so the actual grid can communicate back and forth with the computer. The hardware team was in charge of the physical grid which consisted of the circuit that was built using logic chips such as MUXs, and Flip-Flops, wiring, creating a map on the grid with houses, roads, school, power stations, sub-stations, transmission lines, and distributions lines. The commercial site consists of shopping area, factories, stadium, school and so forth. In final stages of the project, testing, debugging and troubleshooting was performed in order to assure that hardware components and related software can communicate back and forth in a proper sequence. Much of the requirements had the made along the way since this was very new to all students. Phase II: Design and Implementation The design started immediately after the clear definition of the project requirement and purpose. To lower the cost and improve the safety, the design would be a DC (Direct Current) representation of an AC (Alternate Current) system. The system was designed by drawing out the model of a city and the specific buildings to exist in that city. The design was based on what took place in the planning stage which defined how the city and buildings will receive their power and the power. Figure 2. The process of building a smart grid The next challenge in the design process was solving the problem of switches and smart meters. Figure 2 shows the design of the smart meters and placement of LEDs (Light Emitting Diode). The LEDs will represent whether a particular house, building or transformer has power on or off. If for any reason an LED was not lit, then that particular item does not have power. The faults were determined by voltages because even if the building wasn’t drawing power, then there still would be a voltage on the line. This voltage was then sent to a 64 to 1 multiplexor which was then sent to the microcontroller to determine faults. To turn the power of buildings “on” and “off” a common NPN transistor (2n2222) and the base current was provided by a flip flop integrated circuit. Flip flops were used due to I/O’s limitations of the PIC. Figure 3 was duplicated for every transformer, with the only difference being the number of buildings being fed from the transformer which is the first LED after the 12V source. Figure 3. Circuit diagram for buildings Implementation A Smart Grid system includes a power meter which enables the communication systems to update the utility about its condition and the electronics to control the meter. The old electromechanical meters that were used are becoming obsolete since they cannot support the features that the utilities desire to have such as monitoring and controlling power supplied to its customers. Utilities wishes to monitor power consumption so that they can accurately predict how much power will be used during peak and down times. This information is helpful in producing sufficient energy and better efficiency in power waste. It can also help to pinpoint locations of power outages leading to a quicker recovery time. Challenges in implementation of the system are based on a couple of issues. First is the cost. It could cost upwards of $1000 for each smart meter, depending on features to be installed for each house or business. The costs can add up quickly, and the utilities don't see any immediate savings or incentive to deploy the smart grid in a very near future. The system designed in this project is using smart meters with a simulated wireless connection to the central servers at the utilities. The meters would send a signal to the central computer to update its status, power consumption, and other things. It can be designed in a way that it will have a battery backup for when the power is interrupted, or have the central computer assume it is off when it doesn't send a signal at the regular time intervals. Obviously the latter option would be the most cost effective and would use less power to run. But having power to the smart meter could also be beneficial because diagnostics could be run to determine if the power went out or if the meter is having its own internal hardware problems. A wireless signal was simulated for this project, but in real world application one can use either wireless, normal phone lines, or communications over power line. Most utilities already have communications systems set up through their power lines and using this method would be most cost effective. Having wireless, on the other hand, frees up usage of the power lines reducing their stress and prolonging the cables life. Companies are developing and testing their own systems using one of those options. In any case, it is based on hardware availability and cost effectiveness. Figure 4 illustrates communication with the smart grid. Figure 4. Communication with the smart grid Phase III: Documentation and Students’ Assessment In phase III of the project, the students provided a detail documentation of the project which includes cost analysis and different phases of the design.

LITERATURE SURVEY K.Ashokkumar, Baron Sam, R.Arshadprabhu, Britto [1] proposes the advances in cloud computing and web of things (IoT) have provided a promising chance to resolve the challenges caused by the increasing transportation problems. They tend to gift a unique multilayered conveyance knowledge cloud platform by exploitation cloud computing and IoT technologies to resolve the challenges caused by the increasing transportation issues. They present a novel multilayered vehicular data cloud platform by using cloud computing and IoT technologies. Two innovative vehicular data cloud services, an intelligent parking cloud service and a vehicular data mining cloud service in the IoT environment are also presented reviews. Amir-Mohammad Rahmani, Nanda Kumar Thanigaivelan, Tuan Nguyen Gia, Jose Granados, Behailu Negash, Pasi Liljeberg, and Hannu Tenhunen [2] proposes the strategic position of gateways to offer several higherlevel services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. Michele Nitti, Luigi Atzori, and Irena Pletikosa Cvijikj [3] addressed the issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability.They first propose five heuristics, which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure. Thet then perform extensive experiments, which are intended to analyze the performance in terms of giant components, average degree of connections, local clustering, and average path length. Jianli Pan, Raj Jain, Subharthi Paul, Tam Vu, Abusayeed Saifullah, Mo Sha [4] proposes an IoT framework with smart location-based automated and networked energy control, which uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing technologies to enable multiscale energy proportionality including building-, user-, and organizational-level energy proportionality. They further build a proof-of-concept IoT network and control system prototype and carried out real-world experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. They envision that the broad application of the proposed solution has not only led to significant economic benefits in term of energy saving, improving home/office network intelligence, but also bought in a huge social implication in terms of global sustainability Catarinucci, L. , de Donno, D. , Mainetti, L. , Palano, L.

Staying true to the IoT vision, they propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over lowpower wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network International Conference on Science and Engineering for Sustainable Development (ICSESD-2017) (www.jit.org.in) International Journal of Advanced Engineering, Management and Science (IJAEMS) Special Issue-1 https://dx.doi.org/10.24001/icsesd2017.49 ISSN : 2454-1311 www.ijaems.com Page | 195 infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. Al-Fuqaha, A., Kalamazoo, MI, Guizani, M. , Mohammadi, M., Aledhari, M.

They also provides an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, they explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. They also presents the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Stecca, M., Moiso, C., Fornasa, M., Baglietto, P.

AEP was designed to coherently fulfill a set of requirements covered only partially or in a fragmented way by other IoT application platforms. AEP focuses on SO virtualization and on composite application (CA) orchestration and supports dynamic object availability. Yi-Bing Lin, Yun-Wei Lin, Chang-Yen Chih, Tzu-Yi Li [8] proposes an IoT device which is characterized by its “features” (e.g., temperature, vibration, and display) that are manipulated by the network applications. If a network application handles the individual device features independently, then we can write a software module for each device feature, and the network application can be simply constructed by including these brick-like device feature modules. Based on the concept of device feature, brick-like software modules can provide simple and efficient mechanism to develop IoT device applications and interactions. Ganz, F. , Puschmann, D. , Barnaghi, P. , Carrez, F. [9] provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current stateof-the-art in this area and also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, they introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets. Aijaz, A. , Aghvami, A.H.[10] provides the state of the art in cognitive M2M communications from a protocol stack perspective, covers the emerging standardization efforts and the latest developments on protocols for cognitive M2M networks which includes a centralized cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol, a distributed cognitive MAC protocol, and a specially designed routing protocol for cognitive M2M networks. These protocols explicitly account for the peculiarities of cognitive radio environments. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols not only ensure protection to the primary users (PUs) but also fulfil the utility requirements of the secondary M2M networks. Tsirmpas, C., Anastasiou, A., Bountris, P., Koutsouris, D. [11] proposes a new methodology based on self organizing maps (SOMs) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms for profile generation as regards the activities of the user and their correlation with the available sensors. Moreover, we utilize the provided context to assign the generated profiles to more contextually complex activities. This methodology is being evaluated into an AAL structure equipped with several sensors. More precisely, they assess the proposed method in a data set generated by accelerometers and its performance over a number of everyday activities Mainetti, L., Lecce, Mighali, V. ; Patrono, L. [12] proposes a software architecture to easily mash-up constrained application protocol (CoAP) resources. It is able to discover the available devices and to virtualize them outside the physical network. These virtualizations are then exposed to the upper layers by a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface, so that the physical devices interact only with their own virtualization. Furthermore, the system provides simplified tools allowing the development of mash-up applications to different-skilled users. Finally, the architecture allows not only to monitor but also to control the devices, thus establishing a bidirectional communication channel. Hasan Omar Al-Sakran [13] presents a novel intelligent traffic administration system, based on Internet of Things, which is featured by low cost, high scalability, high compatibility, easy to upgrade, to replace traditional traffic management system and the proposed system can improve road traffic tremendously.

It is based on a common conceptual data model of great generality that allows both humans and machines to work with interrelated, but disjoint, information as if it was a single global database. The design and implementation of a general, scalable, federated and flexible data storage and indexing model, which corresponds to the data model of the Semantic Web, is fundamental for the success and deployment of such a system. The generality of the RDF data model presents unique challenges to efficient storage, indexing and querying engines. This paper presents our experience and work related to RDFStore which implements a new flexible indexing and query model. The model is tailored to RDF data and is designed around the Semantic Web from the ground up. The paper describes the underlying indexing algorithm, together with comparisons to other existing RDF storage and query strategies. Towards a lightweight database architecture The generality of the RDF data model presents unique challenges to efficient storage, indexing and querying software. Even if the Entity-Relational (ER) data model [1] is the dominant technology for database management systems today, it has limitations in modeling RDF constructs. RDF being unbounded, the resulting data structures are irregular, expressed using different data granularity, deeply nested or even cyclic. As a consequence, it is not possible to easily fix the ""structural view"" of a piece of information (object), which is instead one of the fundaments of traditional RDBMS systems trying to be much narrower and precise as possible and where an update not conforming to a single static schema is rejected. Database systems also optimize data storage and retrieval by knowing ahead of time how records are structured and interrelated and tend to use very inefficient nested SQL SELECT statements to process nested and cyclic structures. All this is too restrictive for RDF data. Like most semi-structured formalisms [2][3] RDF is self-describing. This means that the schema information is embedded with the data, and no a priori structure can be assumed, giving a lot of flexibility to manage any data and deal with changes in the data's structure seamlessly at the application level. The only basic structure available is the RDF graph itself, which allows describing RDF vocabularies as groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources [4]. All new data can be ""safely"" accepted, eventually at the cost of tailoring the queries to the data. On the other side, RDF data management systems must be much more generic and polymorphic like most of dynamically-bound object-oriented systems [5]; changes to the schema are expected to be as frequent as changes to the data itself and could happen while the data is being processed or ingested. A drawback of RDF heterogeneity is that the schema is relatively large compared to the data itself [6]; this in contrast to traditional RDBMS where the data schema is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the data. This also implies that RDF queries over the schema information are as important as queries on the data. Another problem is that most RDF data (e.g. metadata embedded into an HTML page or RSS1.0 news feed) might exist independently of the vocabulary schemas used to mark-up the data, further complicating data structure ""validation"" (RDF Schema validation). This de-coupling aspect also makes the data ""de-normalization"" more difficult [7][8][9]. ""De-normalization"" is needed in RDBMS to overcome query performance penalties caused by the very general ""normalized"" schemas. De-normalization must be done taking into account to how the database will be used and how data is initially structured. In RDF this is not generally possible, unless all the RDF Schema definitions of the classes and properties used are known a-priori and available to the software application. Even if that might be the case, it is not a general rule and it would be too restrictive and make RDF applications extremely fragile. In the simplest and most general case, RDF software must associate the semantics to a given property exclusively using the unique string representation of its URIs. This will not stop of course more advanced and intelligent software to go a step further and retrieve, if available, the schema of the associated namespace declarations for validation, optimization or inference purposes. It is interesting to point out that a large part of queries foreseen for Web applications are information discovery and retrieval queries (e.g. Google) that can ""ignore"" the data schema taxonomy. Simple browsing through the RDF data itself or searching for some sub-string into literals, or using common patterns is generally enough for a large family of RDF applications. On the other hand, we strongly believe that RDBMS has proven to be a very effective and efficient technology to manage large quantities of well-structured data. This will continue to be true for the foreseeable future. We thus see RDF and similar less rigid, or semi-structured data technologies as complementary to traditional RDBMS systems. We expect to see RDF increasingly appear in the middle layer where lightweight systems that focus on interoperability, flexibility and a certain degree of decoupling of rigid formats are desired. We believe that a fundamentally different storage and query architecture is required to support the efficiently and the flexibility of RDF and its query languages. At a minimum such storage system needs to be: Lightweight Native implementation of the graph Fundamentally independent from data structure Allow for very wide ranges in value sizes; where the size distribution is not known in advance, most certainly is not Gaussian and will fluctuate wildly. Be efficient it should not be necessary to retrieve very large volumes of data in order to reconstruct part of the graph. Allow built support for arbitrary complex regular-path-expressions on the graph to match RDF queries like RDQL [50] statement triple-patterns. Have some free-text support Context/provenance/scope or flavoring of triples Furthermore given that RDF and the Semantic Web are relatively new, and will require significant integration and experimentation it is important that its technology matches that of the Internet: Easy to interface to C, Perl and Java at the very least. Ruby, Python, Visual Basic and .NET are a pre. Easy to distribute (part of) the solution across physical machines or locations in order match scaling and operational habits of existing key Internet infrastructure. Very resistant to ""missing links"" and other noise. Contexts and provenance A RDF statement represents a fact that is asserted as true in a certain context space time, situation, scope, etc. The circumstances where the statement has been stated represent its ""contextual"" information [10][11]. For example, it may be useful to track the origin of triples added to the graph, e.g. the URI of the source where triples are defined, e.g. in an RDF/XML file, when and by whom they where added and the expiration date (if any) for the triples. Such context and provenance information can be thought of as an additional and orthogonal dimension to the other components of a triple. The concept is called in the literature ""statement reification"". Context and provenance are currently not included in the RDF standardisation process [48][49], but will hopefully adressed in a next release of the specification. From the application developer point of view there is a clear need for such primitive constructs to layer different levels of semantics on top of RDF which can not be represented in the RDF triples space. Applications normally need to build meta-levels of abstraction over triples to reduce complexity and provide an incremental and scaleable access to information. For example, if a Web robot is processing and syndicating news coming from various on-line newspapers, there will be overlap. An application may decide to filter the news based not only on a timeline or some other property, but perhaps select sources providing only certain information with unique characteristics. This requires the flagging of triples as belonging to different contexts and then describing in the RDF itself the relationships between the contexts. At query time such information can then be used by the application to define a search scope to filter the results. Another common example of the usage of provenance and contextual information is about digital signing RDF triples to provide a basic level of trust over the Semantic. In that case triples could be flagged for example with a PGP key to uniquely identify the source and its properties. There have been several attempts [12][13][14][15] trying to formalize and use contexts and provenance information in RDF but a common agreement has not been reached yet. However, context and provenance information come out as soon as a real application is built using RDF. Some first examples are presented below. Our approach to model contexts and provenance has been simpler and motivated by real-world RDF applications we have developed [16a][16b][16c]. We found that an additional dimension to the RDF triple can be useful or even essential. Given that the usage of full-blown RDF reification is not feasible due to its verbosity and inefficiency we developed a different modeling technique that flags or mark a given statement as belonging to a specific context. First example considers subjective assertions. The Last Minute News (LMN) [16b] and The News Blender (NB) [16c] demos allow an user rating and qualifying the source newspapers. The user can ""say"" that a newspaper is ""liberal"" or ""conservative"". Of course, two users, X and Y, will show two different opinions. Without considering the context, this will result in two triples: Newspaper A -> Quality -> ""liberal"" Newspaper A -> Qu",oceanology,65,unknown

A hierarchical collective agents network (HCAN) is employed as a solution to this problem. The agents network supports multi-sensor registration, real-time sensor/platform cueing, level-2 and level-3 information fusion, and has an arm toward the level-4 fusion objectives. An agent component assembly and decision-support-system-development environment, the 21 Century systems’ AEDGE software package, is used for the design and implementation of a HCAN-DSS system. The ability to integrate and correlate a vast amounts of disparate information from multiple sensor and heterogeneous data resources with varying degrees of uncertainty in real-time is an impediment issue for missioncritical decision support systems (DSS). For example, in crucial military operations command officers need real-time information and intelligences from various sensors/data resources in a theater of reconnaissance and surveillance to build a whole picture of the battle-space. It is critical for the commanders to know and to understand the relationships among the information collected. Questions are asked: what are the physical and functional constituencies among the objects in a given geographic sector? Are there sequential or temporal dependencies of the objects and what will trigger them? What are the possible consequences of the action and re-actions? Decision making based on these situation assessment and impact assessment (SA/IA) are particularly important for identifying and prioritizing “gaps” between the operation planning and the real-time interactions. To support making effective SA/IA, a data fusion and decision support system is required to use a set of coherent patterns derived from the available data sets and infer the implications (e.g., causal relations) toward the real world situations. The attribute coherence that is critical to the formation of the meaningful knowledge patterns is often obscure in the data sets obtained from heterogeneous resources. The data collections are often incomplete, imprecise, and inconsistent due to various natural constraints and human faults. Decision makers naturally desire to access large quantities of information expressed in diverse forms. However, as new sensor technology and various information sources have combined to create quantity and diversity, it has become increasingly difficult to provide decision makers with the right information at the right time and in the right quantity and format. Real-time computerized decision support systems are constructed by integrating a number of diverse components from a variety of software modules. Software developers have come to a numerous ways of querying the local and centralized data resources to access and distill the large and diverse information for the purpose of providing effective decision support. Meanwhile DSS are becoming more and more complex in terms of knowing which data resources to connect, how to keep track of the data dynamics, and assess the reliability of information from each resources. These tying links make the use of intelligent agent architecture necessary and desirable for allowing real-time responsibility and adaptive control of the DSS. Many popular agent systems of today deploy agents in a uniform level of operation. The agents respond to the same calls and cooperate at the same time toward the same goal of operation. The architecture endues some difficulties in agent communications and task control. When applied in complex real-time DSS with intensive human and system interactions, the cooperative nature makes the system less robust because the disability of one agent would affect the successive operations of the entire agent assembly. The collective nature of the agents in a HCAN paradigm overcomes some of these difficulties, for example, relieving the burden of data-exchanges between fellow agents by limiting agent communication to vertical layers of the assembly only. The hierarchical architecture simplifies the functional design of the agent interactions and enhances the security and efficiency of the process. The HCAN architecture also strikes a balance between the centralized control and distributed computation by allowing distributive agent operations within layers of the hierarchy and enforcing centralized control between the layers of the hierarchy, thus creating a federated agents integration structure. Basically, the HCAN has the functionalities of. 1). A flexible software architecture for accommodating system augmentation and evolutions; 2). A powerful representation schema for accommodating heterogeneous forms of information; 3). A diverse interface for various input resources, output formats, and human interactions; From: AAAI Technical Report WS-02-15. Compilation copyright © 2002, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. 4). An ability of reasoning on incomplete and inconsistent information, and extracting useful knowledge from the data of heterogeneous resources; 5). An ability of incorporating real-time dynamics of information resources into system at time of operation, and promptly adjusting the reasoning mechanisms; 6). An ability of summarizing and refining knowledge extracted, and distinguishing mission and time critical knowledge from insignificant and redundant ones; 7). A capability of supplying meaningful and accurate explanations, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the automated system actions; and 8). A capability of providing adequate control and scrutiny of the system operations w.r.t. environment constrains. There are many sources of uncertainty at different levels of the decision support. For example, even if a situationassessor is aware of the presence of certain objects in the operation space, such as the type of contact, intention, reaction rational, etc., the exact dynamics of the object is still uncertain to the decision maker. While the knowledge about the object dynamics is critical in constructing an optimal strategy of action, various statistical methods and knowledge discovery techniques are applied in the reasoning module. The level of uncertainty forces the reasoning agents to operate with different decision strategies. The 21 Century Systems, Inc. has developed the AEDGE as an open DII-COE and CORBA compliant agentbased environment that enables the development of components-based agent systems. The system is implemented in JavaTM, with Java Database ConnectivityTM for DB access, Java Swing, AWT, and Java3D for visual interfaces, Java Media Framework and Java Speech API for audio/speech interface. AEDGE defines Agents, Entities, Avatars and their interactions with each other and with external sources of information. This standardized architecture allows additional components, such as servicespecific DSS tools, to be efficiently built upon the core functionality. Common interfaces and data structures can be exported to interested parties who wish to extend the architecture with new components, agents, servers, or clients. When the core AEDGE components are bundled with customer-specific components, a clean separation of those components, through APIs, is provided. The AEDGE is based on an extensible multi-component DSS architecture (EMDA, also referred to as the AEDGETM Architecture). The architectures describe the data objects, interfaces, communication mechanisms, component interactions, and integration mechanisms for the AEDGE and its extensions. In the AEDGE architecture, components communicate among each other via the Service Provider/Service Requester Protocol (SPSR). Service providers are components that implement an algorithm or need to share their data (data sources). Service requesters are the components that need a function performed for them by some other component or need to import data from another component. Both service requesters and service providers implement remote interfaces, which enables such components to communicate over a TCP/IP network. The remote interface implementation is currently based on Java RMI (remote method invocation), though the Architecture is not dependent on this implementation. AEDGE provides multiple levels of customization. The subject-matter users are able to build scenarios and scripts or to automatically generate them using the AEDGE-based Scenario Editor. Rules and triggers for agent behaviors can be created and modified by the advanced user. AEDGE also provides APIs for custom extensions of agents, data bridges, and the entity framework. The practical user will enjoy AEDGE’s versatile data connectivity and its near-real-time execution and monitoring of DSS functions. As a built-in bonus, AEDGE provides connections to a number of simulators and data formats, including HLA, DIS, DTED, DBDB2, XML, as well as support for multiple modes of distribution (CORBA, RMI, TCP/IP). As an example of the HCAN design using AEDGE for data fusion and DSS applications, the Advanced Battlestation with Decision Support System (ABS/DSS) which was developed as an operational agent-based C2 team decision support platform for command and control centers aboard aircraft carriers.. The ABS/DSS is based on AEDGE’s implementation of HCAN, and provides consolidated situational awareness through real-time, interactive, agent based decision support coupled with a linked 2D/3D battlespace visualization. Additionally, the ABS/DSS supports shipboard distributed training, train-asyou-fight, with a built-in scenario construction and emulation of friendly and hostile entities. Whether the watchstander is in live-feed mode or in training mode the operation of the agent-based decision support system and the 2D/3D visualization is identical. ",oceanology,66,unknown

For example, calling the getData() command on a sensor component will cause it to later signal a dataReady() event when the hardware interrupt fires. While many components are entirely software based, the combination of split-phase operations and tasks makes this distinction transparent to the programmer. In both cases an event signals that the encryption operation is complete. ADC, ClockC, UART, SlavePin and SpiByteFifo are example hardware abstraction components. TinyOS commands and events are very short, due to limited code space and a finite state machine style of decomposition. The rich event processing model means an event or command call path can traverse several components. The TinyOS component model allows us to easily change the target platform from mote hardware to simulation by only replacing a small number of low-level components. The event-driven execution model can be exploited for efficient eventdriven simulation, and the whole program compilation process can be re-targeted for the simulator‟s storage model and native instruction set. The static component memory model of TinyOS simplifies state management for these large collections. Setting the right level of simulation abstraction can accurately capture the behavior and interactions of TinyOS applications. Figure 1.3: TinyOS Structure (Consist of scheduler and graph of components) 2.3 TOSSIM: A Simulator for TinyOS Sensor Networks The Necessity of Network Simulation: The emergence of wireless sensor networks brought many open issues to network designers. Traditionally, the three main techniques for analyzing the performance of wired and wireless networks are analytical methods, computer simulation, and physical measurement. However, because of many constraints imposed on sensor networks, such as energy limitation, decentralized collaboration and fault tolerance, algorithms for sensor networks tend to be quite complex and usually defy analytical methods that have been proved to be fairly effective for traditional networks. Furthermore, few sensor networks have come into existence, for there are still many unsolved research problems, so measurement is virtually impossible. It appears that simulation is the only feasible approach to the quantitative analysis of sensor networks. The event-driven nature of sensor networks means that testing an individual mote is insufficient. Programs must be tested at scale and in complex and rich conditions to capture a wide range of interactions. Deploying hundreds of motes is a daunting task, the focus of work shifts from research to maintenance, which is time-consuming due to the failure rate of individual motes. A simulator can deal with these difficulties, by providing controlled, reproducible environments, by enabling access to tools such as debuggers, and by postponing deployment until code is well tested and algorithms are understood. TOSSIM: TOSSIM is a discrete event simulator for TinyOS sensor networks. Instead of compiling a TinyOS application for a mote, users can compile it into the TOSSIM framework, which runs on a PC. This allows users to debug, test, and analyze algorithms in a controlled and repeatable environment. As TOSSIM runs on a PC, users can examine their TinyOS code using debuggers and other development tools. TOSSIM‟s primary goal is to provide a high fidelity simulation of TinyOS applications. For this reason, it focuses on simulating TinyOS and its execution, rather than simulating the real world. While TOSSIM can be used to understand the causes of behavior observed in the real world, it does not capture all of them, and should not be used for absolute evaluations.

Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a ubiquitous platform recently, and issues regarding the efficiency of energy usage by these devices play a very important role. These devices are equipped with negligible or less amount of battery power to sustain for a long time. Not only that, in most of the scenarios, where these networks are deployed it is infeasible or impossible sometimes to replace the battery power of the sensor nodes. One of the most fundamental aspects for energy consumption in sensor nodes is communication, other than sensing and computation costs. Optimization of communication costs is thus essential, which is a direct consequence of betterment of routing techniques in this type of wireless networks. A major portion of my contribution in this project deals with designing data gathering schemes for wireless sensor networks and optimization of routing techniques, described below. The first in this queue was the HDS or “Hybrid Data Gathering Scheme”. Published in the International Conference of Distributed Computing and Internet Technology (ICDCIT‟10), this work is a novel approach in minimizing not only the communication / energy overhead but also guarantees a minimal energy-latency product. It also distributes the energy consumption by the nodes by rotating the leader node, so as to increase the uniformity of energy content in the nodes. The uniform distribution of energy content in the nodes also helps to lessen the chances of a black hole or a sinkhole problem. The HDS protocol is based on the hybrid combination of two algorithms, SHORT and LBERRA. The LBERRA scheme is used to subdivide the sensor field into predefined clusters, and SHORT is applied to form a binary tree spanning the nodes. There are two types of leader nodes: one for each cluster, forming the root of the tree and the other one is the „sink‟ communicating the gathered data to the Base Station. In each of the data gathering rounds the leader node is changed The second work was related to optimization of routing chain through heuristic techniques. Firstly, I applied Particle Swarm Optimization to create the most energy efficient paths for communication in the sensor field. Then, I investigated the use of Genetic Algorithms (hybridized with simulated annealing) in solving the same problem. In these works, I not only devised the algorithm for the minimum-energy path formation, but also coded it in nesC discussed in the earlier section. The implementation and simulation in nesC guarantees the hardware feasibility of the algorithm in sensor nodes. Packet loss rates were also studied with varying network topology and signal strengths in communication between particular sensor nodes. In all the cases, a standard background noise was considered. This work followed a series of publications including three international conferences and two international journals. An extension of this work was to create energy efficient data gathering trees. Most algorithms developed in literature used greedy algorithms to construct routing trees which in most of the cases did not result in near-optimal energy usage. “ROOT” or “ROuting through Optimized Trees” was an answer to this need.

These architectures increase the deployment and the runtime possibilities because of the number of existing sites. Indeed, the simple separation of the various functional levels as it is done in a classical architecture (Data, Treatment, Presentation) is not enough and the choice of the site of deployment or runtime becomes significant for the optimization of the production of the system. In these architectures, these decisions of distribution are generally made during the implementation phase. The conceptual structures offered to designers to allow them to express their needs for distribution (concepts of packages, business component,..) do not match with the rules used by developers for building their distributed components [Snene04B]. In fact, software components represent a single and autonomous concept of real world. They encapsulate all the data concerning this concept including name, goal, behavior and all other information with regard to them. In fact, a software component is a set of objects that can be physically deployed on two or several sites. It is usually made up of one or of several distributed components that offer together the various aspects of distribution necessary to the software component.

While RFID technology is improving rapidly, a reliable deployment of this technology is still a significant challenge impeding wide-spread adoption. This research investigates system software solutions for achieving a highly reliable deployment that mitigates inherent unreliability in RFID technology. 
We have considered two different problem domains for large scale RFID deployment. One is item tracking and the other is guidance-monitoring. 
The basic contribution of our work is providing novel middleware solution that is able to serve the application taking into account the inherent unreliability of RFID technology. Our path abstraction that uses the physical flow of data as an ally to generate a logical system level flow enhances the performance in many ways. The contributions of this dissertation are summarized below: 
Defining novel system architecture for item tracking applications: We have defined a system architecture referred to as Reliable Framework for RFID (RF2ID) that takes into account the unreliability of RFID devices and provides a scalable, reliable system architecture for item tracking applications. It uses a distributed system abstraction named Virtual Reader (VR) that handles RFID data in different geographic locations. Virtual Path (VPath) is the abstraction that creates channels among the VRs and facilitates a data flow oriented data management in the system. 
Implementation of RF2ID: We have implemented RF2ID that is able to incorporate physical RFID devices as well as emulated devices for scalability study taking into account various real world challenges of large scale RFID deployment. 
Load Shedding Based Resource Management: RF2ID requires a mechanism to handle unexpected system load in the presence of asynchronous arrival of data items. Space based load shedding and time based load shedding techniques are used in RF2ID. The basic idea is to exploit the VR and Vpath abstraction to intelligently share the load among the VRs in the presence of high system load, and yet provide some guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). 
Architecture for GuardianAngel: We define an architecture for an indoor pervasive environment which provides novel system abstraction and communication framework. The layered architecture has distributed computational elements known as the virtual station (VS) that are in charge of serving different regions of the environment. The Mobile Objects (MO) are the physical and logical entities that use sensing device and traverse the environment. The environment itself is tagged with RFID. The MO uses its sensing device to make guidance decisions locally. The VS keeps status information of MOs and keeps coarse grained information of the MO over time and space providing a virtual location for each MO. 
Implementation of GuardianAngel: We have implemented the GuardianAngle system as defined by the architecture. We have used a testbed that uses real RFID readers and tags in the pervasive environment in a limited laboratory setup. We have also developed a distributed system setup using emulated tags for a scalability study of the proposed architecture. We have also implemented a prototype application, to test its feasibility in the real world. 
Evaluation of the system: We have conducted extensive evaluation using the real RFID testbed as well as scalability study using emulated readers and tags. The evaluation using the real RFID tags and readers gives us the credibility of the system under various environmental considerations. The large scale experimentations provide us with scalability and feasibility study to strengthen our limited resource study using real RFID testbed.

GBDE is a strong cryptographic facility for denying unauthorised access to data stored on a ‘‘cold’’ disk for decades and longer. GBDE operates on the disk(-partition) level allowing any type of file system or database to be protected. A significant focus has been put on the practical aspects in order to make it possible to deploy GBDE in the real world. 1 1. Losing data left and right In the last couple of years, gentlemen of the press have repeatedly been able to expose how laptop computers containing highly sensitive or very valuable information have been lost to carelessness, theft and in some cases espionage. [THEREG] The scope of the problem is very hard to gauge, since it is not a subject which the involved persons and, in particular, institutions are at all keen on having exposed. However, a few data points have been uncovered, revealing that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation loses, on average, one laptop every three days. [DOJ0227] When a computer is lost, stolen or misplaced, it is very often the case that the computer hardware represents a value which is insignificant compared to the value of the disk contents. More often than not, the only reason the press heard about it was that the material on the disk was ‘‘hot’’ enough to make the loss of control rattle people at government level. While it is easy to blame these incidents on ‘‘user error’’, as is generally done, doing so makes it a very hard problem to fix. Human nature being what it is, seems to remain just that. In the absence of technical counter measures, administrative measures have been applied, generally with abysmal results. In one case, a bureaucracy has handled the problem according to what could easily be 1 This software was developed for the FreeBSD Project by Poul-Henning Kamp and NAI Labs, the Security Research Division of Network Associates, Inc. under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035 (‘‘CBOSS’’), as part of the DARPA CHATS research program. mistaken for the plot from a classic Buster Keaton movie: First a laptop was forgotten and lost in a taxi-cab.

The next laptop was stolen from a pub while the owner was bowing to the pressures of nature. New policy: employees are not to carry their own laptops outside the office at any time. Laptops will be transported from and to the employees home address by the agency security force and will be chained and locked to a ring in the wall installed by the company janitors. All requests must be filed 3 days in advance on form ##-#. [PRIV] 2. Protecting disk contents Protecting the contents of a computer’s disk can in practice be done in two ways: by physically securing the disk or by encrypting its contents. Physical protection is increasingly impossible to implement. It used to be that disk drives could only be moved by forklift, but these days a gigabyte disk is the size, but not quite yet the thickness, of a postage stamp. While computers can be tied down with wires and bars can be put in front of windows, such measures are generally not acceptable, or at least not judged economically justified in any but the most sensitive operations. That leaves encryption of the disk contents as the only practical and viable mode of protection, and both the practicality and the viability has been somewhat in doubt. Until recently, nearly all aspects of cryptography were a highly political issue, this has eased a lot in the last couple of years and there now ‘‘only’’ remain a number of rather fundamental questions in the area of law enforcement and human rights, which are still unsettled. With the political issues mostly out of the way, the next roadblock is practical: While use of cryptography can never be entirely transparent, the overhead and workload it brings must be reasonable. 2.1. Application level encryption Encryption at the application level has been available for a number of years, primarily in the form of the PGP [PGP] program. This is about as intrusive and demanding as things can get: the user is explicitly responsible for doing both encryption and decryption and must enter the pass-phrase for every operation. 2 Apart from the inconvenience of this extra workload, many org anisations would trust their users neither to get this right nor even to want to get it right. From an institutional point of view it is important that cryptographic data protection can be made mandatory. 2.2. Filesystem level encryption Encryption at the file system level is a tried and acknowledged method of providing protection, but it suffers from a number of drawbacks, mainly because no mainstream file systems offer encryption. Encrypting file systems are speciality items, which means increased cost and system administration problems of all sorts. And since practically all operating systems use their own file system format, cross platform fully functional file systems are very rare. This means that a typical organisation will have to operate with a handful of different methods of encryption, which translates to system administration overhead, user confusion and extra effort to pass security and ISO9000 audits. A secondary, but increasingly important issue is that data which are stored in databases on raw disk, operating system paging areas and other such data are not protected by a cryptographic file system. To protect these would mean adding yet another set of encryption methods, which leads to a situation which is very hard to handle practically and administratively. Finally, file systems have a complex programming interface to the operating system, which traditionally 2 Interestingly, this is so impractical in real world use that various applications with PGP support resort to caching the pass-phrase at the application level, thereby weakening the protection a fair bit. has been subject to both version skew and compatibility problems. 2.3. Disk level encryption Encryption at the disk level can protect all data, no matter how they are stored, file system, database or otherwise. To a user, encryption at the disk level would require authentication before the computer can be used, everything functioning transparently thereafter, with all disk content automatically protected. Given that the programming interface for a disk device is very simple and practically identical between operating systems, there are no technical reasons why the same implementation could not be used across several operating systems. All in all this is a close to ideal solution from an operational point of view. There are significant implementation issues however. In difference from the higher levels, encryption at the disk level has no way of knowing a priori which sectors contain data and which sectors do not; neither is knowledge available about access patterns or relationships between individual sectors. Where application level or file system based encryption schemes can key each file individually, a disk based encryption must key each and every sector individually, ev en if it is not currently used to hold data. It has been argued that the encryption ideally should happen in the disk-drive, and while there are steps in this direction, they do unfortunately seem to have been made for the wrong reasons by the wrong people [CPRM], and have consequently not gained acceptance. Provided the owner of the computer remains in control of the encryption, I see no reason why encryption in the disk drives should not gain acceptance in the future. 3. Why this is not quite simple Several implementations have been produced which implement a disk encryption feature by running the user provided passphrase through a good quality one-way hash function and used the output as a key to encrypt all the sectors using a standard block cipher in CBC mode. A per sector IV for the encryption is typically derived from the passphrase and sector address using a one-way hash function. Tw o typical examples are [CGD] and [LOOPAES]. Unfortunately this approach suffers from a number of significant drawbacks, both in terms of cryptographic strength and deployability. For data to stay protected for decades or even lifetimes, sufficient margin must exist not only for technological advances in brute force technology, but also for theoretical advances in cryptoanalytical attacks on the algorithms used. Protecting a modern disk, typically having a few hundred millions of sectors, with the same single 128 or 256 bits of key material offers an incredibly large amount of data for statistical, differential or probabilistic attacks in the future. Worse, because the sectors contain file system or database data and meta data which are optimised for speed, the plaintext sector data typically have both a high degree of structure and a high predictability, offering ample opportunities for statistical and known plaintext attacks. This author would certainly not trust data so protected to be kept secret for more than maybe fiv e or ten years against a determined attacker. But far more damning to this method is that there can only be one single passphrase for the disk. This effectively rules out the ability for an organisation to implement any kind of per-user or multilevel key management scheme: the only possible scheme is ‘‘one key per disk’’. Add to this that to change the passphrase the entire disk would have to be decrypted and re-encrypted, and we have a model which may work in theory, and can be made to work in practice for a determined individual, but which would fast become an operational liability for any org anisation. 4.

The explosion of data is making storage system a strategic investment priority in the enterprise world. The revenue created by storage system industry steadily increases from $14.2 Billion in 2004 to over $18.4 Billion in 2007. As a key component of enterprise systems, reliable storage systems are critical. However, despite the efforts put into building robust storage systems, as the size and complexity of storage systems have grown to an unprecedented level, storage system problems are common. Unfortunately, many aspects of storage system problems are still not well understood, and most of previous studies only focus on one component - disk drives. 
To better understand storage system problems, we analyzed the failure characteristics of the core part of storage system - the storage subsystem, which contains disks and all components providing connectivity and usage of disk to the entire storage system. More specifically, we analyzed the storage system logs collected from about 39,000 storage systems commercially deployed at various customer sites. The data set covers a period of 44 months and includes about 1,800,000 disks hosted in about 155,000 storage shelf enclosures. Our study reveals many interesting findings, providing useful guideline for designing reliable storage systems. Some of the major findings include: (1) In addition to disk failures that contribute to 20–55% of storage subsystem failures, other components such as physical interconnects and protocol stacks also account for significant percentages of storage subsystem failures. (2) Each individual storage subsystem failure type and storage subsystem failure as a whole exhibit strong self-correlations. In addition, these failures exhibit bursty patterns. (3) Storage subsystems configured with dual-path interconnects experience 30–40% lower failure rates than those with a single interconnect. (4) Spanning disks of a RAID group across multiple shelves provides a more resilient solution for storage subsystems than within a single shelf. 
As we found out that storage subsystem problems are far beyond disk failures, we extend the scope of study to various storage system problems, and study the characteristics of storage system problem troubleshooting from various dimensions. Using a large set (636,108) of real world customer problem cases reported from 100,000 commercially deployed storage systems in the last two years, the analysis show that while some problems are either benign, or resolved automatically, many others can take hours or days of manual diagnosis to fix. For modern storage systems, hardware failures and misconfigurations dominate customer cases, but software failures take longer time to resolve. Interestingly, a relatively significant percentage of cases are because customers lack sufficient knowledge about the system. We also evaluate the potential of using storage system logs to resolve these problems. Our analysis shows that a failure message alone is a poor indicator of root cause, and that combining failure messages with multiple log events can improve problem root cause prediction by a factor of three. 
One key finding is that storage system logs contain useful information for narrowing down the root cause, while they are challenging to analyze manually because they are noisy and the useful log events are often separated by hundreds of irrelevant log events. Motivated by this finding, we designed and implemented an automatic tool, called Log Analyzer, to improve problem troubleshooting process. By applying statistical analysis techniques, the Log Analyzer can automatically infer the dependency relationship between log events, and identify the key log events that capture the essential system states related to storage system problems. By combining classic unsupervised classification techniques - hierarchical clustering with the event ranking techniques, the Log Analyzer can also identify recurrent storage system problems based on similar log patterns, so that previous diagnosis efforts can be systematically retrieved and leveraged. We train the Log Analyze with 18,878 week-long storage system logs and evaluate it with 164 real-world problem cases. The evaluation indicates that the Log Analyzer can effectively reduce the log event number to 3.4%. For most of the 16 real-world problem cases manually annotated with 1–3 key log events, the Log Analyzer accurately ranked the key log events within top 3 without a priori knowledge on how important the events are. For the other 148 problem cases with diagnosis and with root cause information, the Log Analyzer effectively grouped problem cases with the same root cause together with 63–93% accuracy, significantly outperforming other three alternative solutions which only achieve 30–46% accuracy.",oceanology,71,unknown

The microprocessor-based Sequencer is meant to replace traditional, electromechanical sequencers, which are based on relays, contactors, limit switches and other similar devices. The INTEL 8085A microprocessor, combined with interface chips like the AD7575 ADC, the MAX378 multiplexer was used to implement the sequencer. Software was programmed into 2716 EPROM. Actuators and signal conditioning circuits were also designed and implemented. The implemented system was tested and the performance was found to be satisfactory. Introduction Background to the problem : According to Nwachuku[1] microprocessors are the state of the art in electronics digital systems’ design and the Nigerian Engineer, like his counterpart the world over, has no choice but to become interested in them. He contended further that, because of the nature of the microprocessor and its versatility, it becomes possible for the Nigerian engineer to device products to meet local needs using imported chips. This according to him, is the direction of technological development ..In the advanced industrialized and newly industrialized countries, the last couple of decades have seen the extensive application of microprocessors and computers to automate production processes. Specifically, the microprocessor acts as a micro-controller with a fixed program. Here, the microprocessor application system in most cases, involves the determination of values of physical parameters like temperature, pressure, and so on. In Nigeria, not much seems to have been achieved in this area. Some big manufacturing companies in both the public and private sectors of the Nigerian economy have had to change from along monitoring and control of plant operations to microprocessor/computer-based systems. Most of them are based on the programmable logic controllers (PLCs). But all these analog to digital (microprocessor /computer-based) implementations are mostly carried out by foreign firms and personnel, bringing along with them, their designed hardware and software. Even at that, not much is known to have been achieved in the area of deploying this latest-in-technology to improve the production processes of small-scale industries. This project was conceived as a result of a realization of this obvious short-coming. The nature of the problem: All over the world, countries have come to recognize the leading role which small-scale industries play in their economic development. They furnish over forty-percent (40%) of a nation’s output of goods and they also provide a substantial amount of total employment in an economy. A realization of this obvious fact has made the Federal Government of Nigeria to lay emphasis on the need to support Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in order that they act as catalyst for Nigeria’s industrial and economic growth. For example, the Federal Government of Nigeria has floated a Bank of Industries and has set up a Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) with the objective of improving the performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) towards achieving rapid industrialization of Nigeria and for the reversal of its over dependence on imports.

No part of contents of this paper may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means without the written permission of Trans Tech Publications Ltd, www.scientific.net. (Semanticscholar.org-19/03/20,17:18:59) However, it must be realized that, the success of these initiatives and of Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMIs) themselves, would depend on indigenous locally developed production processes and technologies. Failures of this class of industries in the past have largely been attributed to their over dependence on imported production processes, technologies, and by extension, on imported plants, equipments and machines. The Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) of Nigeria have identified the dearth of process equipment and machinery as the bane of Nigeria’s under-utilization of her agricultural and mineral raw materials. This now places a huge burden on the Nigerian engineer to now start to design, implement, and practicalize new production processes, machines, equipment and plants that can be deployed by the old and emerging SMIs. The Federal Government of Nigeria seems to have set the ball rolling by the establishment of a National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP). The literature is replete with works on interfacing microprocessors with real life situations which is exemplified by the following: Hosier[2] reviewed briefly, the issues that has to be addressed when interfacing a microprocessor to perform real world monitoring and control operations. Anazia [3] gave an overview of the status of microprocessor applications in industrial process control as it relates to the Guinness Plant in Benin-City, Nigeria. A PC-Based Data Acquisition and Supervisory Control system for a Small-Scale Industry was designed and implemented by [4]. Mansfield[5] described the use of transducers for industrial measurement purposes. Program and Data Stores design and Input/Output interfacing were well treated by Short[6]. Gregory[7] explained in good details signal conditioning circuits design. General description of the microprocessor based sequencer The groundnut-oil production plant operates as a series of logically controlled sequence of states; for example, agitator ON, crusher OFF and so on; the duration of each state being determined by sensor signals, for example, temperature or pressure; these sequence of states were transferred into software. The software part (application program), in consonance with the process-sequential flowchart (SFC) that describes the operation of the plant was written in assembler. A major part of the plant consists of electrical and mechanical components like motors which are controlled by electro-mechanical relays, these in turn are operated by signals from the microprocessor; therefore, OUTPUT INTERFACE circuits were designed. Other signals are fed to the microprocessor from temperature, pressure, and other sensors; INPUT INTERFACE circuits were therefore, also designed. The microprocessor system must have memory for storing the application program and for implementing intermediate computations and such other operations. INPUT transducers’ outputs are memory-mapped. The Y2 output of the 74ALS138 decoder that was used addresses a memory address range of 1000Hex to 17FFHex. Therefore, the six (6) input transducers reside at addresses 1000H, 1001H, 1002H, 1003H, 1004H and 1005H respectively. The analog-to-digital converter converts input voltages of between 0volts and 5volts to binary outputs of between 00000000 and 11111111, that is, between 00Hex to FFHex. The output ports (74LS373s) were assigned to a separate address space different from that occupied by main memory; hence, they were isolated or standard I/O. Therefore, the designed and implemented system is as shown in block diagrammatic form, in Fig. 1. Description of the Designed and Implemented System In Fig. 1, block 1 represents the transducers. Block 2 represents the signal conditioning circuits that condition the transducers’ signals to match the multiplexer’s-MAX 378(block 3) inputs. The combination of the multiplexer and the sample and hold-AD781 JN(block 4) selects and holds an input for the analog-to-digital converter-AD7575 JN (block 5) to convert for the input ports (block 6). Block 7 (INTEL 8085A) is the microprocessor subsystem. Block 8 is an address/data bus decoder (74ALS373), while block 9 is an address decoder (74ALS138) for the memory subsystem(blocks 10-4118 and 11-2716). Block 12 represents the output ports (74ALS373) and 108 Advances in Materials and Systems Technologies",oceanology,72,unknown

At the same time, the continued growth of the Internet/WEB and its associated standard developments leads to new ways of world-wide information communication, distribution and access to information. This paper introduces to the various developments undertaken in the VEGA 1 project for a tighter integration of STEP, CORBA and WEB technologies within a DIS . Thus, the VEGA platform will allow both the support of distributed heterogeneous and interoperable client/server information systems (through CORBA) and the support of WEB based access to information and services through an Internet based navigation, building upon CGI and Java technologies. 1. Context and problematical issues The Large Scale Engineering (LSE) and Manufacturing universe is nowadays facing an increasing competitive environment where flexibility and adaptability to change are the bound paths to success, leading companies to renew their way of working. This is due to economical and technological drivers. Indeed, industrial enterprises are now devoted to the specification, design and construction of still larger and more complex manufacturing products: it has become no more possible to a single even-wide enterprise to take in charge the realisation of the whole products, both for financial reasons and because the required skills are not all within the enterprise. Thus, companies and SMEs ( Small and Medium Enterprises ) are now on the way of constituting virtual enterprises (VEs) for each new project. In a VE, contractors, partners, suppliers and customers form a temporary aggregation of non co-located actors dealing with the same product, but focusing on their core domain of competence for the shared profitability of industrial projects. At the same time, current progress in IT , providing more reliable and relevant mechanisms and software tools, the development of sophisticated new frameworks in client/server applications, and the continued growth of the Internet enable improved business processes and provide organisations with new business opportunities. Companies are now widely deploying their applications in Internet and Intranet 4 environments, assembling advanced IT based architectures encompassing among others networking, distributed information systems and concurrent engineering. In such a context, the VEGA project is developing a mandatory infrastructure for the support of the LSE business processes, particularly on the base of main standards for information modelling and exchange, with STEP (ISO 10303) or the IFC developed by the IAI , distribution and interoperability mechanisms with the OMG 6 CORBA and IIOP de facto standards, and WEB technology based on HTTP /CGI and Java. VEGA intends to cover the general needs of companies in VEs and Intranets, with a focus on the Building & Construction sector. Its main objective is to provide an information management architecture to guaranty interoperability among various software components running on different platforms, targeting STEP distributed technologies as an approach to bridge the gap between multiple and delocalised software systems in the construction industry. Within VEGA, the development of the DIS is a first approach towards an end-user oriented service for access to information through various forms. In the AEC field, large projects require the involvement of many body entities (client, architect, design engineers, various technical engineers, etc.) sitting at various locations, with different views and needs on the project, and managing different forms of documents like textual documents, structured documents, drawings, and so on. Dealing with all these kinds of information representations on the client side lead to consider, as far as possible, standardised front-end services. Access to information can be related to EDI 9 too. Until now, EDI has always been considered as a technology typically based on EDIFACT syntax and rules. But EDI can be considered as a kind of generic term, including all aspects of technical and commercial information exchange without mandatory requirements with respect to specific communication technology. Indeed, EDI can be considered from two different points of view: • the first one is a rather conceptual one: the EDI is a structured electronic exchange of data of any type between computer applications of parties involved in a transaction ; • the second is an operational one, where we consider means to realise the task as announced in the first point of view. With respect to these operational means, the Internet is nowadays more and more acknowledged as the common medium to support communication facilities within the development of client/server applications that deserve the larger audience. The WEB technology builds upon HTTP to provide the users with high-level graphical applications independent of the underlying client platform. Furthermore, the Java language now simplifies the development of WEB applications through the power and flexibility of a real object-oriented language. The Intranet perspective enfavours the use of WEB technologies on LANs 10 on a company scale, whether it be real or virtual. Therefore, a different approach has been applied in the VEGA DIS, considering EDI in the broad sense and consequently managing EDI messages through distributed networked infrastructures, emerging WEB standards (mainly HTML and VRML formats), and WEB technologies like CGI and Java. 2. Integration of new technologies in the VEGA project 2.1 Overview of the VEGA project As previously mentioned, the VEGA 11 project objective is to develop an IT platform enabling companies in a VE to work together. VEGA leans on available technology, and extend their capabilities as needed for engineering collaboration in a flexible distributed environment. To address the problem of information sharing, VEGA deals with 3 different technologies: • product-data modelling for the specification of meaningful project information; • middleware technology for the distribution of project information; • workflow management for the control of the flow of information and work in the VE. The VEGA platform relies on high level open standards for the three technologies listed above, including STEP and particularly EXPRESS for the neutral specification of product model data, CORBA for communication between distributed applications and distribution of objects over networks, workflow technology as defined by the WfMC 12 for design of process control, and information standards like SGML 13 or various WEB de facto standards for the support of valueadded distributed information services (exchange of administrative messages, document handling, presentation of information). Thus, VEGA is currently elaborating the fundamental grounds for distributed architectures, defining a service layered on top of CORBA (the COAST – COrba Access to STEP models [2]), for remote data access and manipulation of information models defined by explicit meta-models (or schemata) satisfying the STEP EXPRESS semantics. 2.2 STEP and the IAI If different software applications need to communicate and inter-operate, they first need to share the same information, without misunderstanding or loss of semantics. This implies a common way to represent and exchange the semantics. Such issues have led to dramatic research efforts to achieve effective product data exchanges, standardisation of methodologies, languages and technologies, especially in the context of PDT , among them: • STEP ([3], [4]), developed in ISO TC184/SC4 16 for the product data representation and exchange. It allows the expression in a uniform and complete way of all the information required for a product life-cycle (especially through the EXPRESS language [5]), and supplies means for exchanging data physical files [6] and sharing product databases [7] with models and applications independent mechanisms. STEP is today deeply used for real world product information modelling, communication and interpretation. • IFC [8], another major effort currently undertaken by a non-profit alliance (IAI) of the building industry including architects and engineers, building clients, software vendors, and so on. The main IAI objective is to specify the IFC as a universal model to be a basis for collaborative work in the building industry and consequently to improve communication, productivity, delivery time, cost, and quality throughout the design, construction, operation and maintenance life cycle of buildings. STEP and IAI share the same goals, i.e. application interoperability; data exchange and actor cooperation, but differ in their respective processes. The IAI promote a bottom-up approach, with an iterative and incremental development for fast implementation. STEP is a long-term project, with a top-down approach and is concerned with broad standardisation. The IAI, having a formal liaison status with STEP has partially adopted the STEP technology, mainly through an EXPRESS representation of the IFC. In the future, an integration of the IFC within STEP is planned. As an initiative driven by leading companies, the IAI is pushing the IFC as a de facto standard in the Building industry in a very near future. A key point of the VEGA infrastructure is to use PDT and especially EXPRESS to describe and store meaningful product information. Implementing the VEGA vision requires a tight coupling between STEP models and all the various components of the VEGA platform (including distribution layer, workflow, data storage). Eventually, the current IFC 1.5 release will be used in the final VEGA demonstration . 2.3 The CORBA standard CORBA ([9], [10], [11]) is an OMG specification for application interoperability and portability in distributed architectures, allowing objects described in any language to be shared across heterogeneous operating system",oceanology,73,unknown

As other countries globally, UK is keen for economic development and investment in smart city missions to create interest in monetary environment and inward investment. This paper explores the driving forces of smart road transport transformation and implementation in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: The study involved interviews with sixteen professionals from the UK road transport sector. A semi-structured interview technique was used to collect experts’ perception, which was then examined using content analysis. Findings: The results of the study revealed that the technological advancement is a key driver. The main challenges faced for the implementation of smart city elements in the UK road network are: lack of investment; maintenance; state of readiness and the awareness of the smart road transport concept. The study concludes that an understanding of the concept of smart cities from a road transport perspective is very important to create awareness of the benefits and the way it works. A wider collaboration between every sector is crucial to create a successful smart city. Originality/value: The study contributes to the field of digitalisation of road transport sector. This paper reveals the key driving forces of smart road transport transformation, the current status of smart road transport implementation in UK and challenges of the smart road transport development in the UK. Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ecaam 2 Introduction Enormous global urbanisation and growth has caused migration of people in urban areas and spatial development of urban infrastructure. According to Obaidat and Nicopolitidis (2016), 85-90% of the world population evolution is a result of a 21 st century cities. Therefore, smart cities are being created from scratch or being developed gradually by improving the prevailing cities infrastructure and primary resources. A study of McKinsey Global Institute’s by Department for Business innovation and Skills (2013) shows that more than 50% of the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is generated in the 190 major cities in the developed countries compare to 22 largest cities in the developing countries. However, the increase of growth in the developed countries is healthy but this phenomena also set a high expectation on public services and the quality of the urban infrastructure and environment. Due to the urbanisation, more problems such as overpopulation, pollutions, scarcity of natural resources, public and private services are being created (Yigitcanlar et. al. 2020, Dameri, 2014). Smart cities are an emerging strategy to mitigate the problems generated by the rapid urban population growth and rapid urbanization (Prakash, 2019). A ‘smart city’ is defined as an urban area that is highly innovative in terms of overall facilities, ecological real estate, communication and market feasibility (Chirisa et al, 2016). Also, smart cities is defined as “a place where the traditional networks and services are made more efficient with the use of digital and telecommunication technologies, for the benefits of its inhabitants and businesses” (Kumar et al., 2018). Whereas BSI (2014) noted that smart cities as an effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in a built environment to deliver sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens. From the above three definitions, it could be inferred that smart cities are cities that make use of physical, digital and human systems in order to enable sustainability and efficiency for the citizens within that city. The economic growth of any country is supported by its good infrastructure. The United Kingdom (UK) has strategic roads, railway and airports; however, it is one of the top 10 most congested country in the world (Korosec, 2018). According to ONS (2017), the population in the UK in 2016 was 65.6 million which was the largest ever. It is also projected that the population in the UK would grow, reaching over 74 million by 2039. Due to the population rise amalgamated with increase of cars on the road, which has increased by 4.6% higher than the previous peak in 2016 (Department of Transport, 2017), the present UK transport system faces many challenges. The UK road transportation system is gradually taking steps to overcome the problems. As road transport is a significant source of both safety and environmental concerns. This research aims to explore the driving forces of smart road transport transformation, and implementation in the UK along with the challenges faced. In doing so the next section delves into the relevant literature review followed by methodology and findings. The paper finally concludes with recommendations. 2. Literature review An extensive review of literature on drivers, current status of smart cities and the challenges are discussed in this section. Three main drivers include: technology, environment, and socioeconomy (See Table 1). The technological advancement is clearly seen as strong impact on the cities in the recent years. It can be seen clearly that, the communication technologies (ICT) develops city management, enhances technical and social networks, and urban affordability. Within the technology as a driver, the review of literature revealed that technologies such as Big Data, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are widely Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ecaam 3 implemented within the smart cities context. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on the UK smart road transport sector.

Patrick Leserf (ESTACA) Trade-off analysis with SysML and Papyrus : a drone application Obtaining the set of trade-off architectures from a SysML model is an important objective for the system designer. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology combining SysML with the variability concept and multiobjectives optimization techniques. An initial SysML model is completed with variability information to show up the different alternatives for component redundancy and selection from a library. The constraints and objective functions are also added to the initial SysML model, with an optimization context. Then a representation of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is generated with an algorithm from the optimization context and solved with an existing solver. The presentation will illustrate our methodology by designing an Embedded Cognitive Safety System (ECSS). From a component repository and redundancy alternatives, the best design alternatives are generated in order to minimize the total cost and maximize the estimated system reliability. Benoît Combemale (IRISA) Using models for a broader engagement in smart systems. Various disciplines use models for different purposes. While engineering models, including software engineering models, are often developed to guide the construction of a non-existent system, scientific models, in contrast, are created to better understand a natural phenomenon (i.e., an already existing system). An engineering model may incorporate scientific models to build a smart system. This talk proposes a vision promoting an approach that synergistically combines engineering and scientific models to enable broader engagement of end users in smart systems, informed decision-making based on more-accessible scientific models and data, and automated feedback to the engineering models to support dynamic adaptation of smart systems. To support this vision, we identify a number of challenges to be addressed with particular emphasis on the socio-technical benefits of modeling. Claire Ingram (Newcastle University) CPSE-Labs experiments of UK centre: Pragmatic techniques for modelbased Engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems Newcastle University's Cyber-Physical Systems Lab conducts research into pragmatic techniques for model-based engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). In this talk I will introduce some platforms supported by Newcastle's CPS Lab, including an approach for co-modelling which allows separate design teams working with discrete-event and continuous-time formalisms to develop CPS designs collaboratively. I will also introduce an experiment which has been funded previously under the CPSE Labs initiative. Michael Siegel (OFFIS) CPSE-Labs experiments of Germany North centre: The Maritime Architecture Framework (MAF) and eMaritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR) The Maritime Architecture Framework (MAF) is a stakeholder-oriented CPS architecture framework for existing and future maritime CPS and services. MAF provides the conceptual basis, methods, tools and technologies to define, document, and align existing or future CPS architectures and architectural reference models for e-navigation and e-maritime applications. The MAF is a key enabler in the maritime domain for system harmonization, interoperability and standardization. The MAF is also a reference for the definition and design of testbeds for enavigation and e-maritime systems and services. It helps to define the context, to check completeness and provides a semantic basis to discuss the outcome and results. Additionally it offers a semantic basis for integration of testbeds e.g. for larger demonstrators. To support the development of maritime CPS – i.e. the integration of heterogeneous systems of the maritime transportation space , the Design Centre North provides the eMaritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR) for rapid prototyping in simulation environments and testing in real world environments. This talk gives an overview about the background, context and concepts of the MAF and why testbed environments (e.g. eMIR) for the development, integration testing and demonstration for CPS must take into account and support the design aspects of such an architecture framework. Andre Pierre Mattei (SCA-ITA) SysML Design of an observation satellite for agriculture surveillance in Brazil François Fouquet (SnT, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust)Models for managing IoT data Internet of Things applications analyze our past habits through sensor measurements to anticipate future trends. To yield accurate predictions, intelligent systems not only rely on single numerical values, but also on structured models aggregated from different sensors. Computation theory, based on the discretization of observable data into timed events, can easily lead to millions of values. Time series and similar database structures can efficiently index the mere data, but quickly reach computation and storage limits when it comes to structuring and processing IoT data. During this talk, I will present various results presented at Models’15 and SmartGridCom’15 that tackles this complexity by exploiting IoT data characteristics. Notably, I will present a concept of continuous models that can handle high-volatile IoT data by defining a meta type for continuous attributes. In addition to traditional discrete object-oriented modeling APIs, we enable models to represent very large sequences of sensor values by inferring mathematical models that can efficiently replace raw values. We show on various IoT datasets that sequences of polynomials can significantly improve storage and reasoning efficiency. I will present an application of this IoT model extension for suspicious value detection in the SmartGrid domain. We proposed a method to learn and store a profile of “typical” values and their probability in IoT context models. We show that using such profiles together with a contextual checker we can improve suspicious value detection, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

(More information on this project, which involves a number of industrial and research partners from Europe, can be found at: http://certus-sfi.no/u-test-a-horizon-2020-funding-recipient/). Fabien Peureux Fabien Peureux (Femto-st/EGM/Smartesting S&S) Model-Based Testing for Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems Testing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is challenging due to the various uncertainties in their behaviour. The purpose of this talk is to present our ongoing work on a model-based testing framework for automatic generation of executable test cases for CPS in the presence of various uncertainties. Basically, uncertainties can be described as a lack of certainty about the current state or about the future outcome of the system. Within CPS, it can be due to the stimulus and data sent from the user environment to the physical units (application level), to the interactions between the physical units and the network services (infrastructure level), or a combination of the both (integration level). To test such issues, the proposed model-based testing approach is implemented on the EMF framework, and based on the test generation tool Smartesting CertifyIt1. It relies on a UML behavioral model of the system under test, from which abstract test cases are automatically generated by applying dedicated coverage strategies focusing on uncertainty testing.

WSN is a very active and competitive research area due to its diverse and unlimited potential applications: air, underground and underwater. In spite of its young age, economic impact of WSN is important, for examples the industrial control segment market will be worth $5.3B by 2010 and the smart home market will be worth $2.8 billion worldwide by 2012 (Source: Stamatis Karnouskos, EU-US 08 Workshop). WSN is a set of wireless nodes. On one hand, each wireless node (WN) has similar hardware and software functionalities as a PC: CPU, memory, operating system, and communication protocol to fulfill a specific task. On the other hand, a WN has a limited power supply (embedded battery) and consumes approximately 1 million less power (~100μW instead of ~100W) than a PC. Due to resources constraints: energy consumption and form factor, the approaches applied in general purpose computer systems are not adapted to the requirements of WSN. When it comes to the design of energy efficient oriented hardware and software components of WSN, cross-layering optimization approaches are generally adopted such as application-specific unified hardware and software by taking into account the following criteria: trade-off between complexity, efficiency and resource consumption, and application context (context-aware) etc. Currently two main hardware development and design trends are carried out to implement the WN: Commercial OffThe-Shelf ‘COTS’ and System on Chip ‘SoC’. The first and second generations of WN were designed by using low power 8-bit or 16-bit microcontroller processor core, Bluetooth and non standard wireless access medium (MICA Mote). The current trend of WN design such as Tmotesky, iMote and LiveNode are based on low power 16-bit or 32-bit RISC microcontroller, and full compliance IEEE802.14.5 standard. However the ultimate goal of all the researchers in the world is the implementation of long life, low cost and invisible WN integrated and embedded into environment. Three key technologies make possible to achieve this objective: MEMS ‘MicroElectroMEchanical systems’, UWB ’Ultra-Wide Band’ and low power CMOS technology. Different WN prototypes are realized by Intel (iMOTE2), University of Michigan (MOTE: Michigan Uni Prototype) and University of Berkeley (Pico-Mote). WN hardware seems easier to solve than embedded software for diverse WSN applications. The main questions which are related to WSN basic software design is how to keep modularity, high level abstraction and reliability to enable to implement complex massively distributed WSNs to meet resource constraint requirements. Real-time operating system (RTOS) plays a key role to support high level abstraction and distributed collaborative processing. Currently four categories of WSN’s RTOS are developed: Event driven (TinyOS), Multitask (RETOS, tKernel, NutOS, MANTIS), Data-Centric (AmbientRT), and Hybrid (Contiki, LIMOS). Note that TinyOS is very popular but it not adapted to complex hard real-time application. The development challenges of the WSN RTOS are energy-efficiency (context aware, configurable, small footprint), robustness, fault tolerance, support hard real-time constraint, and support component based model (high level of abstraction to ease the integration of high level SW such as protocol, middleware, application, and simulator). Furthermore, for WSN applications, message sending is energy consuming. Thus it is important to implement embedded energy efficient wireless routing protocol to increase WSN lifetime. It is clear that general purpose MANET routing protocol such as AODV (active), OLSR (proactive) and ZBR (hybrid) etc. are not suitable for WSN due to resource constraints. For example optimal routing path is well adapted to general purpose MANET but not suitable for WSN because the repetitive use of the same path will exhaust the battery of WNs belonging to the optimal routing path (black hole). Many WSN dedicated protocols are implemented (spin, cougar, gear, leach, speed ...) but it is currently very difficult to have a clear idea concerning their performance (energy consumption, scalability, connectivity, lifetime ...) because of the lack of large scale WSN real world experimentation results and because the simulation model does not reflect the real-world ones (physical layer). Note that, there is no standard scenario and the application program (with a known number of WNs) enables to evaluate rationally the performance of wireless routing protocols. In addition routing protocol relies on the WSN topology. On one hand, an optimal WSN topology facilitates the implementation of routing and administration protocols. On the other hand, the deployment of large scale WS nodes in a large area is random and its topology is a priori unknown. Then, it is important to investigate the auto-configuration algorithms to increase the efficiency of routing and administration protocols. However the frontier between the administration protocol and the routing protocol is not as clearly defined as in a classical network (e.g. TCP/IP and SNMP) due to cross-layering approach. Moreover WSN security, reliability, and fault tolerance are still an open problem. In this special issue 5 papers are selected among 40 submitted papers for the NTMS workshop on wireless sensor network: theory and practice, held at Tangier at Morocco in 2008, the rest of the papers are selected from an open call for paper. WSN is a multi-disciplinary science. It impossible to present all its topics but this special issue addresses most of the WSN embedded software problems dealing with real-world applications (EU NeT-ADDED FP6 project, French ANR research project and industrial projects).

In such human networks, people come across one another, while their mobile devices exchange and store information in a spontaneous and transparent way. Such an encounter could be established through direct device-todevice connectivity when two devices come into each other’s communication range, or be enabled by, e.g., a Wi-Fi access point, when the devices both enter its coverage. A new form of dissemination, which we call opportunistic messaging, is such an application that is based on human encounters and mobilities. When human encounters are exploited for communications, the reliance on network infrastructure access is eliminated; communications can be performed even where infrastructure is absent or infrastructure access is intermittent. By leveraging human mobilities, data delivery does not require an end-to-end path from the source to a recipient; instead, people carrying mobile devices serve as relays – they cache others’ data and forward/deliver the data when appropriate. Thus, the propagation of information is tied to people’s physical proximity when they move around, and incorporates the social aspects of communications as people tend to spend more time co-locating with their social relations. Opportunistic messaging is applicable anywhere, and is especially appealing where network infrastructure access is limited or intermittent (e.g., on cruise ships, in national parks, after disasters). Another intriguing characteristic of it is its ease of deployment – no central server is needed, but only a single piece of software on users’ mobile devices. However, as human encounters and mobilities are unpredictable, when used for social applications, opportunistic messaging is most suited for disseminating user-generated information that is non-formal, less important, and thus not time-critical. In recent years, a considerable amount of efforts have been invested in the research on opportunistic networking and delay-tolerant networking (which encompasses opportunistic networking but is a broader concept). A large portion of prior work has focused on routing issues, e.g., through whom as intermediate carriers to deliver a message to the destinations [1] [2] [3] [4]. The routing issues have been further explored in various contexts, such as in vehicular networks [5] [6] [7] and in social networking applications [8] [9] [10] [11]. However, serious real-world application development, deployment and evaluation of the opportunistic networking concepts still fall behind [12], in which many challenging issues remain to be addressed (to name a few, location-awareness, user incentives and preferences, power preservation, encounter controls, etc.). In this work, we design and prototype PassItOn, a fully distributed opportunistic messaging system. Our goal is to build up a proof-of-concept platform on real mobile devices, and thus show the feasibility and potentials of utilizing human movements for dissemination applications. Meanwhile, we seek to shed lights on the design, implementation and deployment issues in building such systems, and thus stimulate new ideas and perspectives on addressing these issues.

For a long time, the numerical approach to computational solution of mathematical problems had an advantage of being capable of solving a substantially larger set of problems than the other approach, the symbolic one. Only recently the symbolic approach gained more recognition as a viable tool for solving large-scale problems from physics, engineering or economics, reasoning, robotics or life sciences. Developments in symbolic computing were lagging relative to numerical computing, mainly due to the inadequacy of available computational resources, most importantly computer memory, but also processor power. Continuous growth in the capabilities of computer hardware led naturally to an increasing interest in symbolic calculations and resulted, among others things, in development of sophisticated Computer Algebra Systems (CASs). CASs allow users to study computational problems on the basis of their mathematical formulations and to focus on the problems themselves instead of spending time transforming the problems into forms that are numerically solvable. While their major purpose is to manipulate formulas symbolically, many systems have substantially extended their capabilities, offering nowadays functionalities like graphics allowing a comprehensive approach to problem solving. While, typically, CAS systems are utilized in an interactive mode, in order to solve large problems they can be also used in a batch mode and programmed using languages that are close to common mathematical notation. As CASs become capable of solving large problems, they follow the course of development that has already been taken by numerical software: from sequential computers to parallel machines to distributed computing and finally to the grid. It is particularly the grid that has the highest potential as a discovery accelerator. Currently, its widespread adoption is still impeded by a number of problems, one of which is difficulty of developing and implementing grid-enabled programs. That it is also the case for grid-enabled symbolic computations. There are several classes of symbolic and algebraic algorithms that can perform better in parallel and distributing computing environments. For example for multiprecision integer arithmetic, that appears among others in factorizations, were developed already twenty years ago systolic algorithms and implementations on massive parallel processors, and more recently, on the Internet. Another class that utilize significant amount of computational resources is related to the implementations of polynomial arithmetic: knowledge based algorithms such as symbolic differentiation, factorization of polynomials, greatest common divisor, or, more complicated, Groebner base computations. For example, in the latest case, the size of the computation and the irregular data structures make the parallel or distributed implementation not only an attractive option for improving the algorithm performance, but also a challenge for the computational environment. A third class of algorithms that can benefit from multiple resources in parallel and distributed environments is concerning the exact solvers of large systems of equations. The main reason driving the development of parallel and distributed algorithms for symbolic computations is the ability to solve problems that are memory bound, i.e. that cannot fit into memory of a single computer. An argument for this statement relies on the observation that the input size of a symbolic or algebraic computation can be small, but the memory used in the intermediate stages of the computation may grow considerably. Modern CASs increase their utility not only through new symbolic capabilities, but also expending their applicability using visualization or numerical modules and becoming more than only specific computational kernels. They are real problem solving environments based on interfaces to a significant number of computational engines. In this context it appears also the need to address the ability to reduce the wall-clock time by using parallel or distributed computing environment. A simple example is the case of rendering the images for a simulation animation. Several approaches can be identified in the historical evolution of parallel and distributed CASs: developing versions for shared memory architectures, developing computer algebra hardware, adding facilities for communication and cooperation between existing CASs, or building distributed systems for distributed memory parallel machines or even across Internet. Developing completely new parallel or distributed systems, although efficient, in most cases is rather difficult. Only a few parallel or distributed algorithms within such a system are fully implemented and tested. Still there are several successful special libraries and systems falling in this category: ParSac-2 system, the parallel version of SAC-2, Paclib system, the parallel extension of Saclib, FLATS based on special hardware, STAR/MPI, the parallel version of GAP, ParForm, the parallel version of Form, Cabal, MuPAD, or the recent Givaro, for parallel computing environments, FoxBox or DSC, for distributed computing environments. An alternative approach to build parallel and distributed CASs is to add the new value, the parallelism or the distribution, to an existing system. The number of parallel and distributed versions of most popular CASs is impressive and it can be explained by the different requirements or targeted architectures. For example, for Maple there are several implementations on parallel machines, like the one for Intel Paragon or ||Maple||, and several implementations on networks of workstations, like Distributed Maple or PVMaple. For Mathematica there is a Parallel Computing Toolkit, a Distributed Mathematica and a gridMathematica (for dedicated clusters). Matlab that provides a Symbolic Math Toolbox based on a Maple kernel has more than twenty different parallel or distributed versions: DP-Toolbox, MPITB/PVMTB, MultiMatlab, Matlab Parallelization Toolkit, ParMatlab, PMI, MatlabMPI, MATmarks, Matlab*p, Conlab, Otter and others. More recent web-enabled systems were proved to be efficient in number theory for finding large prime numbers, factoring large numbers, or finding collisions on known encryption algorithms. Online systems for complicated symbolic computations were also built: e.g. OGB for Groebner basis computations. A framework for description and provision of web-based mathematical services was recently designed within the Monet project and a symbolic solver wrapper was build to provide an environment that encapsulates CASs and expose their functionalities through symbolic services (Maple and Axiom were chosen as computing engines). Another platform is MapleNet build on client-server architecture: the server manages concurrent Maple instances launched to server client requests for mathematical computations. WebMathematica is a similar system that offers access to Mathematica applications through a web browser. Grid-oriented projects that involve CASs were only recent initiated. The well-known NetSolve system was one of the earliest grid system developed. Version 2 released in 2003 introduces GridSolve for interoperability with the grid based on agent technologies. APIs are available for Mathematica, Octave and Matlab. The Genss project (Grid Enabled Numerical and Symbolic Services) follows the ideas of the Monet project and intends also to combine grid computing and mathematical web services using a common agent-based framework. Several projects are porting Matlab on grids: from small ones, like Matlab*g, to very complex ones, like Geodise. Maple2g and MathGridLink are two different approaches for grid-enabled version of Maple and Mathematica. Simple to use front-end were recently build in projects like Gemlca and Websolve to deploy legacy code applications as grid services and to allows the submission of computational requests. The vision of grid computing is that of a simple and low cost access to computing resources without artificial barriers of physical location or ownership. Unfortunately, none of the above mentioned grid-enabled CAS is responding simultaneously to some elementary requirements of a possible implementation of this vision: deploy grid symbolic services, access within CAS to available grid services, and couple different grid symbolic services. Moreover a number of major obstacles remain to be addressed. Amongst the most important are mechanisms for adapting to dynamic changes in either computations or systems. This is especially important for symbolic computations, which may be highly irregular in terms of data and general computational demands. Such demands received until now relatively little attention from the research community. In the context of a growing interest in symbolic computations, powerful computer algebra systems are required for complex applications. Freshly started projects shows that porting a CAS to a current distributed environment like a grid is not a trivial task not only from technological point of view but also from algorithmic point of view. Already existing tools are allowing experimental work to be initiated, but a long way is still to be cross until real-world problems will be solved using symbolic computations on grids.

In particular, the system learns the customers' situation, meaning, and action from their action history, and reflects a feedback of the result to predict the next action.

One such attack is phishing, which aims at stealing user information via deceptive websites. The primary defense against phishing consists of maintaining a black list of the phishing URLs. However, a black list approach is reactive and cannot defend against new phishing websites. For this reason, a number of research have been done on using machine learning techniques to detect previously unseen phishing URLs. While they show promising results, any such implementation is yet to be seen. This is because 1) little work has been done on developing a complete end-to-end framework for phishing URL detection 2) it is prohibitively slow to detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms.

The article studies theoretical approaches to ensuring the cyber resilience of banks, which made it possible to develop a conceptual model of the mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience, adequate to the current state and conditions in which the banks of Ukraine operate. The developed mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience allows for: 1) the formalization of the landscape of real and potential cyber threats; 2) ensures the consistency of mechanisms and tools for countering them, adapting and/or recovering from cyber incidents; 3) allows not only to adequately respond to existing cyber threats but also to identify negative factors that can lead to the emergence and implementation of new cyber threats and cyber-attacks. According to the results of the study, it was found that the effective functioning of the mechanism for ensuring the cyber resilience of the bank requires appropriate organizational support. For this, the author substantiated the need to create a Bank Cyber Resilience Center.

We find that given a fixed run time, our algorithm outperforms a simple implementation of our MILP model, generating a feasible schedule in which 17% more activities are scheduled by the algorithm than by the simple implementation. We design a non-MILP based heuristic to further validate our results. We find that our algorithm also outperforms this heuristic, scheduling 8% more activities and 20% more tracking time than the best results achieved by the non-MILP implementation.",space,95,unknown

Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities such as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity operations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an effective system for model development that streamlines data curation, training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges. The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a cloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset, to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses (positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code. Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality. Remote development, scalable compute, and automatic organization of data and artifacts have dramatically decreased iteration time while increasing reproducibility and system comprehension. Diverse, high-fidelity synthetic images that more closely replicate the real environment have improved model performance against real-world data. These results demonstrate that the presented pipeline offers tangible benefits to the application of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations.",space,97,unknown

A biologically realistic architecture of cooperative-competitive associative networks (implemented as a control system for mobile agents) emulates PC activity during local navigation in exploration and goal-retrieval. The system builds and stores panoramic views from landmarks and compares them with current inputs. Mismatch-induced low levels of recognition trigger a vigilance burst, which favors either the recognition of an alternative place category or the creation of a new category. The sole implementation of visual ""What"" and ""Where"" information does not restrain the generality of the model since several modalities could cooperate to give rise to more robust place field spatial categories. Providing the system with real visual inputs automatically extracted from a natural environment demonstrates that interspecies differences in PC coding result more from characteristics of the visual systems than from differences in processing. Conversely, differences in PC multiple codes within a system result from different levels of processing and/or different degrees of multimodality. Each code could be used within different navigational strategies. A control system derived from the model allows a mobile agent to learn a few places and the associated actions required to reach a goal.

However the time complexity of the algorithm to explore clusters in subspaces is exponential in the dimensionality of the data and is thus extremely compute intensive.

In this paper, we study training algorithms for deep learning on heterogeneous CPU+GPU architectures. Our two-fold objective - maximize convergence rate and resource utilization simultaneously - makes the problem challenging. In order to allow for a principled exploration of the design space, we first introduce a generic deep learning framework that exploits the difference in computational power and memory hierarchy between CPU and GPU through asynchronous message passing. Based on insights gained through experimentation with the framework, we design two heterogeneous asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. The first algorithm - CPU+GPU Hogbatch - combines small batches on CPU with large batches on GPU in order to maximize the utilization of both resources. However, this generates an unbalanced model update distribution which hinders the statistical convergence. The second algorithm - Adaptive Hogbatch - assigns batches with continuously evolving size based on the relative speed of CPU and GPU.

In addition, the refugees suffer from the shortage of necessary resources due to impaired life infrastructure, such as damaged roads and communication networks. The degree of reducing damage depends on the amount of food, water, daily necessities and communication resources required by each shelter. How to effectively and efficiently allocate resources according to grasp the exact need of a disaster situation will be an important issue. We estimate the degree of the disaster by collecting and analyzing big data from the SNS, and building a platform for the communication resources to be efficiently and effectively allocated. In order to achieve this goal, we are challenging the following issues A) Understanding situations (user requirements) after disaster occur The SNS streams large scale semantic information about real time situation in society, especially during and after disaster. It is both domain-specific and computational challenge in processing the heterogeneous large data set to extract the exact situational content with reduced semantic uncertainty. The machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NPL) tool kits are useful in semantic analysis, but still needs domain-specific implementation and computational improvement for the situation understanding from the SNS big data. B) Understanding distribution patterns of situations/users' requirements The disaster related situation is spatiotemporally correlated, and varies dynamically in space and time. It is also domain-specific and computational challenge in estimating the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the disaster affect based on the spatial big data from SNS. The scan statistics such as the spatial scan have provided well tested mathematical tools and software for spatial data mining. However, new methodologies are necessary since the assumptions have to be different when it meets the spatial big data in SNS. And the computational complexity in spatial big data is also a bottleneck for real-time processing.

However, the sequential centralised implementation of this learning approach makes it unsuitable for real applications, where large volumes of traces are produced continuously, while both deviant and normal behaviours tend to change over the time. We here propose an online deviance detection framework that leverages a novel incremental learning scheme, which extracts different base models from different chunks of a trace stream, and dynamically combines them in an ensemble model. Notably, the system is based on a p2p architecture that allows it to distribute the entire learning procedure among multiple nodes and to exploit the power of HPC resources (e.g. cloud computing environments).

A promising trend to address the issue is to identify the abnormal data that differs from the normal data by utilizing normal (oneclass) data to learn the manifold and detect the anomaly to the unseen and unlabeled data in an/aunsupervised/semi-supervised manner. In this paper, we propose Anobeat, a semi-supervised approach, to perform the abnormal beat detection by facilitating adversarial regularized autoencoders constrained with multifeature and reconstruction error. In order to obtain a robust and reasonable latent coding, we deploy two discriminators in the latent space and visual space to distinguish real and fake features and minimize the distance between two features to train the visual discriminator in alternate steps. Meanwhile, we minimize the reconstruction error and maximum distance between input and noise features to improve the decoder. The adversarial multi-feature constraints enable the generator to learn the latent representations of the target normal data and reconstruct the beats properly.

For this reason, wireless devices will need to continuously adapt to current spectrum conditions by changing their communication parameters in real-time. Therefore, wireless signal classification (WSC) will become a compelling necessity to decode fast-changing signals from dynamic transmitters. Thanks to its capability of classifying complex phenomena without explicit mathematical modeling, deep learning (DL) has been demonstrated to be a key enabler of WSC. Although DL can achieve a very high accuracy under certain conditions, recent research has unveiled that the wireless channel can disrupt the features learned by the DL model during training, thus drastically reducing the classification performance in real-world live settings. Since retraining classifiers is cumbersome after deployment, existing work has leveraged the usage of carefully-tailored Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters that, when applied at the transmitter's side, can restore the features that are lost because of the the channel actions, i.e., waveform synthesis. However, these approaches compute FIRs using offline optimization strategies, which limits their efficacy in highly-dynamic channel settings. In this paper, we improve the state of the art by proposing Chares, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based framework for channel-resilient adaptive waveform synthesis. Chares adapts to new and unseen channel conditions by optimally computing through DRL the FIRs in real time. Chares is a DRL agent whose architecture is based upon the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3), which requires minimal feedback from the receiver and explores a continuous action space for best performance. Chares has been extensively evaluated on two well-known datasets with an extensive number of channels.

Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability.

The methodology of classical PCA is based on orthogonal projection defined in convex vector space. Thus, a norm between two projected vectors is unavoidably smaller than the norm between any two objects before implementation of PCA. Due to this, in some cases when the PCA cannot capture the data structure, its implementation does not necessarily confirm the real similarity of data in the higher dimensional space, making the results unacceptable. In order to avoid this problem for the purposes of high dimensional data clustering, we propose new Fuzzy PCA (FPCA) algorithm.

It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that ""Cells that fire together, wire together"", with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning.

These algorithms are applied to train neural networks with weight values confined to a narrow band of integers. We constrain the weights and biases in the range [-2/sup k+1/+1, 2/sup k-1/-1], for k=3, 4, 5, thus they can be represented by just k bits. Such neural networks are better suited for hardware implementation than the real weight ones. Mathematical operations that are easy to implement in software might often be very burdensome in the hardware and therefore more costly. Hardware-friendly algorithms are essential to ensure the functionality and cost effectiveness of the hardware implementation. To this end, in addition to the integer weights, the trained neural networks use threshold activation functions only, so hardware implementation is even easier. These algorithms have been designed keeping in mind that the resulting integer weights require less bits to be stored and the digital arithmetic operations between them are easier to be implemented in hardware. Obviously, if the network is trained in a constrained weight space, smaller weights are found and less memory is required. On the other hand, as we have found here, the network training procedure can be more effective and efficient when larger weights are allowed.

Online spike sorting, the process of assigning neural spikes to an identified group of neurons or clusters, is a necessary step to make a closed-loop path in real time, but massive memory-space requirements commonly limit hardware implementations.

The stimulator supports both voltage-controlled and current-controlled arbitrarily shaped waveforms with the programmable amplitude and duration of pulse. An empirical algorithm for online real-time spike sorting is implemented in an FPGA.

In this paper, we introduce the immersive interaction scenario offered by spoken dialogues to CAPT by proposing a recursive dialogue game to make CAPT personalized. A number of tree-structured sub-dialogues are linked sequentially and recursively as the script for the game. The system policy at each dialogue turn is to select in real-time along the dialogue the best training sentence for each specific individual learner within the dialogue script, considering the learner's learning status and the future possible dialogue paths in the script, such that the learner can have the scores for all pronunciation units considered reaching a predefined standard in a minimum number of turns. The purpose here is that those pronunciation units poorly produced by the specific learner can be offered with more practice opportunities in the future sentences along the dialogue, which enables the learner to improve the pronunciation without having to repeat the same training sentences many times. This makes the learning process for each learner completely personalized. The dialogue policy is modeled by Markov decision process (MDP) with high-dimensional continuous state space, and trained with fitted value iteration using a huge number of simulated learners.

Such operations can be carried out by industrial robots in multiple ways because an industrial robot is typically functionally redundant with respect to a finishing task. In the proposed system, a human expert demonstrates a finishing operation, and the demonstrated motion is recorded in the Cartesian space. The robot’s kinematic model is augmented with a virtual mechanism, which is defined according to the applied finishing tool. This way, the kinematic model is expanded with additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to compute the optimal joint space motion of the robot without altering the essential aspects of the Cartesian space task execution as demonstrated by the human expert. Finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, occur in contact with the treated workpiece. Since information about the contact point position is needed to control the robot during the operation, we have developed a novel approach for accurate estimation of contact points using the measured forces and torques. Finally, we applied iterative learning control to refine the demonstrated operations and compensate for inaccurate calibration and different dynamics of the robot and human demonstrator. The proposed method was verified on real robots and real polishing and grinding tasks. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>—This work was motivated by the need for automation of finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, on contemporary industrial robots. Existing approaches are both too complex and too time-consuming to be applied in flexible and small-scale production, which often requires the frequent deployment of new applications. Our approach is based on programming by demonstration and enables the programming of finishing operations also for users who are not specialists in robot programming. Programming by demonstration is especially useful for teaching finishing operations because it enables the transfer of expert knowledge about finishing skills to robots without providing lengthy task descriptions or manual coding. Besides the human demonstration of the desired operation, the proposed approach also requires the availability of the kinematic model for the machine tool applied to carry out the finishing operation. We provide several practical examples of grinding and polishing tools and how to integrate them into our approach.

We show that in our approach, the best mapping is able to approximate the best arm selection policy to any desired degree under mild Lipschitz conditions. Therefore, we design our algorithm based on the optimal adaptive combination and asymptotically achieve the performance of the best mapping as well as the best arm selection policy. This optimality is also guaranteed to hold even in adversarial environments since we do not rely on any statistical assumptions regarding the contexts or the loss of the bandit arms. Moreover, we design an efficient implementation for our algorithm using various hierarchical partitioning structures, such as lexicographical or arbitrary position splitting and binary trees (BTs) (and several other partitioning examples). For instance, in the case of BT partitioning, the computational complexity is only log-linear in the number of regions in the finest partition. In conclusion, we provide significant performance improvements by introducing upper bounds (with respect to the best arm selection policy) that are mathematically proven to vanish in the average loss per round sense at a faster rate compared to the state of the art.

However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-learning to learn the shortest path on the building model’s graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actor–critic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces. Hence, our model achieves near optimal performance on the real world emergency environment.",space,146,unknown

A run of HC requires multiple iterations, each of which needs to compute and update the pairwise distances between all intermediate clusters. This makes the exact algorithm for HC inevitably suffer from quadratic time and space complexities. To address large-scale data, various approximate/parallel algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of HC. However, such algorithms still rely on conventional linkage methods (such as single, centroid, average, complete, or Ward's) for defining pairwise distances, mostly focusing on the approximation/parallelization of linkage computations. Given that the choice of linkage profoundly affects not only the quality but also the efficiency of HC, we propose a new linkage method named NC-link and design an exact algorithm for NC-link-based HC. To guarantee the exactness, the proposed algorithm maintains the quadratic nature in time complexity but exhibits only linear space complexity, thereby allowing us to address million-object data on a personal computer. To underpin the extensibility of our approach, we showthat the algorithmic nature of NC-link enables single instruction multiple data (SIMD) parallelization and subquadratic-time approximation of HC. To verify our proposal, we thoroughly tested it with a number of large-scale real and synthetic data sets. In terms of efficiency, NC-link allowed us to perform HC substantially more space efficiently or faster than conventional methods: compared with average and complete linkages, using NC-link incurred only 0.7%-1.75% of the memory usage, and the NC-link-based implementation delivered speedups of approximately 3.5 times over the centroid and Ward's linkages. With regard to clustering quality, the proposed method was able to retrieve hierarchical structures from input data as faithfully as in the popular average and centroid linkage methods. We anticipate that the existing approximation/parallel algorithms will be able to benefit from adopting NC-link as their linkage method for obtaining better clustering results and reduced time and space demands.",space,149,unknown

It is assumed that the unknown dynamics can be estimated using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy model with arbitrary precision. The successful implementation of a PI scheme depends on the effective learning of critic network parameters. Network parameters must stabilize the system in each iteration in addition to approximating the critic and the cost. It is found that the critic updates according to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman formulation sometimes lead to the instability of the closed-loop systems. In the proposed work, a novel critic network parameter update scheme is adopted, which not only approximates the critic at current iteration but also provides feasible solutions that keep the policy stable in the next step of training by combining a Lyapunov-based linear matrix inequalities approach with PI. The critic modeling technique presented here is the first of its kind to address this issue. Though multiple literature exists discussing the convergence of PI, however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no literature, which focuses on the effect of critic network parameters on the convergence. Computational complexity in the proposed algorithm is reduced to the order of (F<sub>z</sub>)<sup>n-1</sup>, where n is the fuzzy state dimensionality and F<sub>z</sub> is the number of fuzzy zones in the states space.

The number of possible search trees in ML is at least exponential, thereby making runtimes on even modest-sized datasets to clock up to several million CPU hours. Evaluation of these trees, involving node-level likelihood vector computation and branch-length optimization, can be partitioned into tasks (or kernels), providing the application with the potential to benefit from hardware acceleration.

We present the concept of self-distributing systems, in which any local system built using our framework can learn, at runtime, the most appropriate distributed design given its perceived operating conditions. Our concept abstracts distribution of a system’s sub-components to a list of simple actions in a reward matrix of distributed design alternatives to be used by reinforcement learning algorithms.

Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much smaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. Different from the popular approach of simultaneously training encoder and decoder using neural network models, the CS theory ensures a high probability of accurate signal reconstruction based on random measurements that is shorter than the length of the original signal under a sparsity constraint. Such method is particularly useful when measurements are expensive, such as wireless sensing of civil structures, because its hardware implementation allows down sampling of signals during the sensing process. Hence, CS methods can achieve significant energy saving for the sensing devices. However, the strong assumption of the signals being highly sparse in an invertible space is relatively hard to guarantee for many real images, such as image of cracks. In this paper, we present a new approach of CS that replaces the sparsity regularization with a generative model that is able to effectively capture a low dimension representation of targeted images.

We demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method that takes advantage of the strong capability of generative models to capture the necessary features required in the crack segmentation task even the backgrounds of the generated images are not well reconstructed.

In this sense, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self-adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(λ) (TOSL) with QBIASSR can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks. All of these are promising results towards the possibility of learning much more complex tasks autonomously by a robotic agent.",space,200,unknown

The current study presents two implementations of the multiple-expert colour feature extreme learning machine (MEC-ELM). The MEC-ELM is a cascading algorithm that has been implemented along side a summed area table (SAT) for fast feature extraction and object classification, for a fully functioning object detection algorithm. The MEC-ELM is an implementation of the colour feature extreme learning machine (CF-ELM), which is an extreme learning machine (ELM) with a partially connected hidden layer; taking three colour bands as inputs. The colour implementation used with the SAT enable the MEC-ELM to find and classify objects quickly, with 84% precision and 91% recall in weed detection in the Y’UV colour space and in 0.5 s per frame. The colour implementation is however limited to low resolution images and for this reason a colour level co-occurrence matrix (CLCM) variant of the MEC-ELM is proposed. This variant uses the SAT to produce a CLCM and texture analyses, with texture values processed as an input to the MEC-ELM. This enabled the MEC-ELM to achieve 78–85% precision and 81–93% recall in cattle, weed and quad bike detection and in times between 1 and 2 s per frame. Both implementations were benchmarked on a standard i7 mobile processor. Thus the results presented in this paper demonstrated that the MEC-ELM with SAT grid and CLCM makes an ideal candidate for fast object detection in complex and/or agricultural landscapes.",space,201,not included

                  In the age of information superhighway, big data play a significant role in information processing, extractions, retrieving and management. In computational biology, the continuous challenge is to manage the biological data. Data mining techniques are sometimes imperfect for new space and time requirements. Thus, it is critical to process massive amounts of data to retrieve knowledge. The existing software and automated tools to handle big data sets are not sufficient. As a result, an expandable mining technique that enfolds the large storage and processing capability of distributed or parallel processing platforms is essential.
               
                  Method
                  In this analysis, a contemporary distributed clustering methodology for imbalance data reduction using k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classification approach has been introduced. The pivotal objective of this work is to illustrate real training data sets with reduced amount of elements or instances. These reduced amounts of data sets will ensure faster data classification and standard storage management with less sensitivity. However, general data reduction methods cannot manage very big data sets. To minimize these difficulties, a MapReduce-oriented framework is designed using various clusters of automated contents, comprising multiple algorithmic approaches.

Networks with deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, especially with computer vision tasks. Deep learning algorithms such as stacked autoencoder (SAE) and deep belief network (DBN) are built on learning several levels of representation of the input. Beyond simply learning features by stacking autoencoders (AE), there is a need for increasing its robustness to noise and reinforcing the sparsity of weights to make it easier to discover interesting and prominent features. The sparse AE and denoising AE was hence developed for this purpose. This paper proposes an approach: SSDAE-RR (stacked sparse denoising autoencoder – ridge regression) that effectively integrates the advantages in SAE, sparse AE, denoising AE, and the RR implementation in ELM algorithm. We conducted experimental study on real-world classification (binary and multiclass) and regression problems with different scales among several relevant approaches: SSDAE-RR, ELM, DBN, neural network (NN), and SAE. The performance analysis shows that the SSDAE-RR tends to achieve a better generalization ability on relatively large datasets (large sample size and high dimension) that were not pre-processed for feature abstraction. For 16 out of 18 tested datasets, the performance of SSDAE-RR is more stable than other tested approaches. We also note that the sparsity regularization and denoising mechanism seem to be mandatory for constructing interpretable feature representations. The fact that a SSDAE-RR approach often has a comparable training time to ELM makes it useful in some real applications.",space,204,unknown

In problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. However, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. The present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. The method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. Each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. While the initial control area is radial, its shape is adaptively improved using a Hermite interpolation procedure. The modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. As optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. The modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the Greek island of Santorini.

and learn representations of the scene that are more robust and adaptive to several nuisance

factors. Over the recent past, for a variety of tasks involving images, learned representations  have been empirically shown to outperform handcrafted ones.

However, their inability to generalize across varying data distributions poses the following

question: Do representations learned using deep networks just fit a given data distribution or do

they sufficiently model the underlying structure of the problem ? This question could be

understood using a simple example: If a learning algorithm is shown a number of images of a simple handwritten digit, then the representation learned should be generic enough to identify the same digit in

a different form. With regards to deep networks, although the learned representation has been shown

to be robust to various forms of synthetic distortions such as random noise, they fail in the presence of

more implicit forms of naturally occurring distortions. In this dissertation, we

propose approaches to mitigate the effect of such distortions and in the process, study some

vulnerabilities of deep networks to small imperceptible changes that occur in the given input.

The research problems that comprise this dissertation lie in the cross section of two open topics: (1)

Studying and developing methods that enable neural networks learn robust representations (2) Improving

generalization of neural nets across domains.  The first part of the dissertation  approaches the problem of robustness from two broad viewpoints:  Robustness to external nuisance factors that occur in the data and robustness

(or a lack thereof) to perturbations of the learned feature space.  In the second part, we focus on learning representations that are invariant to external covariate

shift, which is more commonly termed as domain shift. 

Towards learning representations robust

to external nuisance factors, we propose an approach that couples a deep convolutional neural

network with a low-dimensional discriminative embedding learned using triplet probability

constraints to solve the unconstrained face analysis problem. While previous approaches in this area have proposed scalable yet ad-hoc solutions to this problem, we propose a principled and parameter free formulation which is based on maximum likelihood estimation. In addition, we employ the principle of transfer learning to realize a deep network architecture that can train faster and on lesser data yet significantly outperforms existing approaches on the unconstrained face verification task. We demonstrate the robustness

of the approach to challenges including age, pose, blur and clutter by performing clustering

experiments on challenging benchmarks.

Recent seminal works have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to visually imperceptible perturbations of the input. In this dissertation, we build on their ideas in two unique ways: (a) We show that neural networks that perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation tasks also suffer from this vulnerability, despite being trained with more extra information compares to simple classification tasks.  In addition, we present a novel self correcting mechanism in segmentation networks and provide an efficient way to generate such perturbations (b) We present a novel approach to regularize deep neural networks by perturbing intermediate layer activations in an efficient manner, thereby exploring the trade-off between conventional regularization and adversarial robustness within the context of very deep networks. Both of these works provide interesting directions towards understanding the secure nature of deep learning algorithms. 

While humans find it extremely simple to generalize their knowledge across domains, machine learning algorithms including deep neural networks suffer from the problem of domain shift across what are commonly termed as 'source' (S) 

and 'target' (T) distributions. Let the data that a learning algorithm

is trained on be sampled from  S. If the real data used to evaluate the model is

then sampled from T, then the learnt model under-performs on the target data. This inability to generalize is characterized as domain shift. 

Our attempt to address this problem involves learning a common

feature subspace, where distance between source and target distributions are minimized. Estimating the distance between different domains is highly non-trivial and is an open research

problem in itself. In our approach we parameterize the distance measure by using a Generative

Adversarial Network (GAN). A GAN involves a two player game between two mappings com-

monly termed as generator and discriminator. These mappings are learned simultaneously by

employing an adversarial game, i.e. by letting the generator fool the discriminator and enabling

the discriminator to outperform the generator. This adversarial game can be formulated as a

minimax problem. In our approach, we learn three mappings simultaneously: the generator,

discriminator and a feature mapping that contains information about both the content and the

domain of the input. We deploy a two-level minimax game, where the first level is a competition

between the generator and a discriminator similar to a GAN; the second level game is where the

feature mapping attempts to fool the discriminator thereby introducing domain invariance in

the learned feature representation. We have extensively evaluated this approach for different

tasks such as object classification and semantic segmentation, where we achieve state of the

art results across several real datasets. In addition to the conceptual novelty, our approach

presents a more efficient and scalable solution compared to other approaches that attempt to

solve the same problem.

In the final part of this dissertation, we describe some ongoing efforts and future directions of research. Inspired from the study of perturbations described above, we propose a novel metric on how to effectively choose pixels to label given an image, for a pixel-wise segmentation task. This has the potential to significantly reduce the labeling effort and our preliminary results for the task of semantic segmentation are encouraging.  While the domain adaptation approach proposed above considered static images, we propose an extension to video data aided by the use of recurrent neural networks.  Use of full temporal information, when available, provides the perceptual system additional context to disambiguate among smaller object classes  that commonly occur in real scenes",space,213,not included

Nell’ambito dell’applicazione di sistemi di early warning per la gestione del rischio geologico legato a queste tipologie di frana, una sperimentazione della tecnica del monitoraggio nanosismometrico è stata effettuata presso due siti estrattivi non più in attività: le “Pirrere” della Baia di Cala Rossa sull’isola di Favignana (Trapani), in Sicilia, e la cava dismessa di Acuto (Frosinone), in Italia Centrale. Il monitoraggio nanosismometrico è una tecnica di indagine che consente di individuare e localizzare deboli eventi sismici, fino a magnitudo locale (ML) nell’ordine di -3, attraverso l’impiego di quattro sensori sismometrici disposti secondo una specifica geometria di array detta SNS (Seismic Navigation System).

Nel presente lavoro, mediante il software NanoseismicSuite sono stati analizzati 73 eventi di crollo indotti artificialmente attraverso la caduta controllata di blocchi di roccia nei due siti estrattivi abbandonati; sono stati lanciati, simulando fenomeni di rockfalls, rispettivamente 47 blocchi di roccia nella cava di Acuto e 26 eventi in quattro diverse cave a cielo aperto presenti nel settore occidentale di Cala Rossa. Tali eventi, avendo punto epicentrale noto, hanno permesso di determinare il miglior modello di sottosuolo in termini di valori di velocità delle onde P ed S attraverso un’operazione di back analysis. L’analisi è stata, infatti, effettuata variando i valori di velocità e scegliendo quelli relativi all’epicentro teorico ottenuto dall’analisi dell’evento che fosse il più vicino possibile al punto reale di impatto del blocco di roccia. Al fine di valutare la sensibilità della geometria dell’array SNS e l’influenza del sito di installazione sulla capacità di individuare e localizzare gli eventi, le sperimentazioni sono state condotte sia variando il raggio di apertura che la zona di installazione degli array: presso Acuto le acquisizioni di segnale sono state condotte prima con un array SNS con apertura di 20 m e successivamente con un array di apertura 10 m, mentre presso Cala Rossa l’array è stato installato alternativamente all’aperto in un’area di plateau roccioso ed in una galleria facente parte dell’area di cava abbandonata.

Analizzando i dati si è ottenuta una precisione dell’ubicazione epicentrale compresa tra il 10 ed il 22% della distanza che intercorre tra la sorgente e l’array nanosismometrico. Il miglior modello di sottosuolo ottenuto per entrambi i casi di studio è risultato avere una velocità delle onde P pari a 900 m/s ed un rapporto VP/VS pari a 1.73, valori in accordo con le condizioni di intenso stato di fratturazione delle rocce carbonatiche affioranti nelle due zone di cava. Per gli eventi di crollo indotti la magnitudo ML è risultata essere compresa tra -2.8 e -1.3; considerando l’energia sviluppata dall’impatto, legata alla massa del blocco ed all’altezza e alla velocità di caduta, non è stato possibile definire una relazione tra magnitudo ed energia, probabilmente a causa delle differenti caratteristiche del punto di impatto dei diversi blocchi. In generale, si è osservato che la precisione di ubicazione degli eventi, in termini di azimuth e distanza dal reale epicentro, è risultata paragonabile sia variando l’apertura dell’array che variando il sito di installazione. Per il sito sperimentale di Acuto, il processo di picking manuale del tempo di primo arrivo delle onde P è risultato essere più affidabile nel caso di array con apertura pari a 10 m. La sperimentazione effettuata a Cala Rossa ha permesso, invece, di osservare una migliore capacità di individuazione degli eventi nelle tracce relative all’array posizionato in galleria a causa della minore rumorosità di base del sito di installazione.

Tra le registrazioni sismometriche sono state identificate varie tipologie di segnali, oltre a quelli generati dal lancio dei blocchi, alcune riconducibili ad eventi naturali di crollo altre a deboli terremoti. L’analisi dei segnali riferibili alla prima tipologia di eventi naturali, effettuata tenendo in considerazione i modelli di sottosuolo precedentemente calibrati, ha portato all’identificazione in ambedue i siti di aree aventi maggiore suscettibilità a frane per crollo. In definitiva, si può ritenere che i risultati ottenuti in questo studio siano incoraggianti rispetto all’efficacia della tecnica di monitoraggio nanosismometrico nell’individuazione e nell’ubicazione di fenomeni di crollo in roccia e portano a ritenere questa tecnica potenzialmente applicabile in aree in cui tali eventi possono interferire con infrastrutture antropiche.In the frame of early warning and risk mitigation studies for landslide processes involving rock masses, two quarry areas (Cala Rossa Bay in Sicily and Acuto in Central Italy) were monitored with SNS (Seismic Navigation System) arrays. In this study, 73 rockfalls were simulated by launches of rock blocks. This allowed to perform a back analysis for defining the best seismic velocity model of the subsoil half-space; the records related to each impact caused by the rock block launch were managed by the nanoseismic monitoring approach, varying the velocity model to obtain a theoretical epicentre as close as possible to the actual location of the impact point. In order to evaluate the sensibility of the SNS array, the results obtained by different array apertures and positions were compared in terms of azimuth and distance error with respect to the real epicentres. On the other hand, several natural rockfalls were detected; their analysis allowed to identify areas having higher susceptibility to rockfalls by using the previously calibrated subsoil half-space model. Further studies are required to better define the areas prone to rockfall generation in the considered test sites; nevertheless, the here obtained results show an encouraging perspective about the application of the nanoseismic monitoring with respect to vulnerable infrastructures in rockfall prone areas",space,214,unknown

The publication of the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) opens a new era in astronomy. It includes precise astrometric data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) for more than 1.3 billion sources, mostly stars. To analyse such a vast amount of new data, the use of data-mining techniques and machine-learning algorithms is mandatory.Aims. A great example of the application of such techniques and algorithms is the search for open clusters (OCs), groups of stars that were born and move together, located in the disc. Our aim is to develop a method to automatically explore the data space, requiring minimal manual intervention.Methods. We explore the performance of a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to find clusters in the data together with a supervised learning method such as an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically distinguish between real OCs and statistical clusters.Results. The development and implementation of this method in a five-dimensional space (l, b, ϖ, μα*, μδ) with the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, and a posterior validation using Gaia DR2 data, lead to the proposal of a set of new nearby OCs.

no longer concerned with the organization of space and matter, but rather a

system of systems with self-organizational behavior and progressively complex

programmatic interventions. Such system represents an Internet of Things (IoT)

paradigm that has the capacity to self-organize a pre-defined architecture

acclimating dynamically to the demands of the environment through a process of

self-awareness and re-configurability.

This paper is an attempt to develop spaces that bring computation into the

physical world by introducing artificial intelligence into building systems so as to

communicate, exchange information, and allow right responses and decisions

within a sustainable manner. Environments with embedded computational

systems and adaptive reconfiguration behavior will be precisely studied.

With an intensive focus on smart, self reconfiguring architecture that has

embraced kinetic motion as an approach for environmental adaptation and

responsiveness. This study addresses the networked organization of sensory

systems that incorporate computational platforms in relation to user’s desires,

where architecture turns into an interactive intermediary between human and

computation.

Correspondingly, the authors are particularly aiming to propose three conceptual

frameworks for delivering a smart system at the architectural scale which is

capable of reconfiguring and interacting constantly in real time, precisely

focusing on an initial implementation for the first framework utilizing an

experimental customized prototype, while the other two frameworks would be

posteriorly studied through future work.

Thus the IoT will foster a rapid development in intelligent systems which would

directly introduce an advanced technological leap forward in accommodating a

new way of demonstrating human-computer interaction within a novel

architectural design approach",space,216,unknown

One of the most incentive ways is for electric companies to institute electricity buying-back schemes to encourage end users to generate more renewable energy. Different from the previous works, we consider renewable energy buying-back schemes with dynamic pricing to achieve the goal of energy efficiency for smart grids. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem as a convex optimization dual problem and propose a day-ahead time-dependent pricing scheme in a distributed manner which provides increased user privacy.

These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology’s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders—consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries—and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers’ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers’ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets.

This is achieved through analysis, modeling, implementation and simulation of artificial markets populated by software agents that represent economic self interested agents. Software agents are the constructs of a complex system, an artificial market that model a real existing market or an outline of a market design. The interest in simulating a market is multiple: exploiting existing market rules, searching for market design flaws and loopholes, and supporting decision making during a market mechanism design process. The main aim of the suggested approach is to analyze the behavior that emerges from the interaction of self interested agents acting in an artificial market. AEMAS (Artificial Economy MultiAgent System), a multiagent system architecture inspired by the Market Oriented Programming (MOP) approach is defined. In different economical sectors, e.g. energy markets, there is no consensus about which structures lead to social welfare maximization outcomes. An approach to find adequate architectures allows different market structure instances to be created and simulated, to ease the design and analysis of alternative structures. These alternatives can then be compared and potential design flaws eventually risen by simulation identified. Taking the electricity market as an example, two instances of the proposed architecture are presented, corresponding to the centralized dispatch arrangement common to non restructured markets, and the auction based pool, common to restructured markets.

Essa abordagem de autenticação de usuários está atraindo grandes investimentos de instituições bancárias e financeiras, especialmente em cenários de diferentes domı́nios, nos quais imagens faciais tiradas de documentos de identificação são comparadas com autorretratos digitais (selfies) tiradas com câmeras de dispositivos móveis. Neste estudo, coletamos das bases de dados do maior banco público brasileiro um grande dataset, chamado FaceBank, com 27.002 imagens de selfies e fotos de documentos de identificação de 13.501 sujeitos. Em seguida, avaliamos os desempenhos de dois modelos de Redes Neurais Convolucionais bem referenciados (VGG-Face e OpenFace) para extração de caracterı́sticas profundas, bem como os desempenhos de quatro classificadores (SVM Linear, SVM Power Mean, Random Forest e Random Forest com o Ensemble Vote) para autenticação robusta de face em diferentes domı́nios.

The use of facial features for biometric authentication of users in banking systems is becoming a worldwide trend, due to the convenience and acceptability of this form of identification, and also because computers and mobile devices already have built-in cameras. This user authentication approach is attracting large investments from banking and financial institutions especially in cross-domain scenarios, in which facial images taken from ID documents are compared with digital self-portraits (selfies) taken with mobile device cameras. In this study, from the databases of the largest public Brazilian bank we collected a large dataset, called FaceBank, with 27,002 images of selfies and ID document photos from 13,501 subjects. Then, we assessed the performances of two well-referenced Convolutional Neural Networks models (VGG-Face and OpenFace) for deep face features extraction, as well as the performances of four effective classifiers (Linear SVM, Power Mean SVM, Random Forest and Random Forest with Ensemble Vote) for robust cross-domain face authentication. Based on the results obtained (authentication accuracies higher than 90%, in general), it is possible to conclude that the deep face matching approach assessed in this study is suitable for user authentication in cross-domain banking applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a large dataset composed of real banking images to assess the cross-domain face authentication approach to be used in banking systems. As an additional, this work presents a study on the real needs in the future implementation of a biometric system proposing a cloud system to enable the adoption of biometrics technologies, creating a new model of service delivery.

Contudo, várias iniciativas empíricas têm demonstrado que a afirmação da TME não é totalmente correta. Entre as frentes de pesquisa que buscam prever os movimentos de ativos financeiros, pode-se destacar a área com um ponto de vista econométrico, que tenta prever movimentos mediante métodos matemáticos e estatísticos, como regressão linear e regressão não linear, bem como as redes neurais. Além disso, em outra área de pesquisa, há a Teoria Multiagente de Modelagem de Mercado (Theory of Multi-Agent Market Modeling) que foca sua atenção na microestrutura do mercado, partindo do princípio de que os movimentos de preços emergem da interação de muitos agentes individuais do mercado. Contudo, esses modelos financeiros baseados em agentes têm algumas limitações. Não é possível adequar os agentes a dados reais do mercado para gerar previsões futuras, pois na maioria dos modelos a tomada de decisão é feita por meio de funções ad-hoc ou mecanismos que não podem ser ajustados a dados externos. Para obter uma previsão real do modelo, é preciso adaptar o mecanismo de decisão dos agentes com modelos econométricos, como as redes neurais, que podem ser ajustadas a séries de dados reais. Dessa forma, por intermédio da interação dos agentes, o modelo de mercado resultante pode capturar a dinâmica oculta do mercado e prever os movimentos futuros com uma eficácia maior do que faria um sistema de regressão não linear isoladamente. Este trabalho propõe um modelo computacional baseado na utilização do comportamento emergente de uma comunidade de agentes de software com mecanismos de decisão cognitiva, baseados em redes neurais, com o objetivo de realizar previsões do comportamento do Índice da Bolsa de Valores de São Paulo # Índice Bovespa. Os agentes da comunidade interagem com um mecanismo de coleta dos valores das 65 ações mais negociadas da Bovespa que compõem o Índice Bovespa, utilizados para computar as previsões de evolução do índice. A fim de validar a hipótese da pesquisa, é feita uma comparação entre os resultados obtidos pelo modelo implementado, com uma abordagem tradicional de previsão baseada exclusivamente em redes neurais. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que as previsões do modelo proposto são mais performáticas do que a previsão isolada do índice baseada exclusivamente em redes neurais, já que o modelo proposto captura melhor a microestrutura do mercado, prevendo um passo a frente de maneira mais eficaz.In finance world , the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) states that the financial assets have random price fluctuation, so, there are not ways to protect the investor forecasting the future market movements. However, several initiatives have shown that empirical assertion of EMH is not entirely correct. Among the research fronts that seek to predict the movements of financial assets, we can highlight the area with an econometric point of view, which attempts to predict movements through mathematical and statistical methods such as linear regression and nonlinear regression, as well as neural networks. Moreover, in another area of research, we have the Theory of Multi-Agent Market Modeling that focuses attention on the micro-structure of the market, assuming that the price movements emerge from the interaction of many actors in the market. However, these financial models based on agents have some limitations. It is not possible to match agents to actual market data to forecast a step ahead, as in most models of decision making is done through ad-hoc functions or mechanisms that can not be adjusted to external data. For a preview of the real model, you need to adapt the decision-making mechanism of the agents with econometric models such as neural networks, which can be adjusted to actual data sets. Thus, through the interaction of the agents, the market model results can capture the hidden dynamics of the market and predict future movements with greater effectiveness than would a system of non-linear regression alone. This paper proposes a computational model based on the use of emergent behavior of a community of software agents with cognitive decision-making mechanisms base on neural networks in order to make predictions of the behavior of the index of He Stock Exchange of São Paulo # Bovespa Index. The agents of the community interact with one engine collects the values of the 65 most actively traded stocks that comprise the Bovespa Bovespa Index, used to compute the projected trend of the index. In order to validate the hypothesis of the study, a comparison is made between the results obtained by the model implemented with a traditional approach to forecasting based solely on neural networks. The results show that by the proposed model are more performing than the forecast index alone based solely on neural networks, since the proposed model better captures the microstructure of the market, and one step ahead more effectively",finance,231,unknown

In such a dynamic environment, raising the autonomy level of the next space missions is key to maintaining a competitive edge in terms of the scientific, technological, and commercial outcome.
We propose the adoption of an AI-based autonomous agent aiming to fully enable spacecraft’s goal-oriented autonomy. The implemented cognitive architecture collects input starting from the sensing of the surrounding operating environment and defines a low-level schedule of tasks that will be carried out throughout the specified horizon. Furthermore, the agent provides a planner module designed to find optimal solutions that maximize the outcome of the pursued objective goal. The autonomous loop is closed by comparing the expected outcome of these scheduled tasks against the real environment measurements.
The entire algorithmic pipeline was tested in a simulated operational environment, specifically developed for replicating inputs and resources relative to Earth Observation missions. The autonomous reasoning agent was evaluated against the classical, non-autonomous, mission control approach, considering both the quantity and the quality of collected observation data in addition to the quantity of the observation opportunities exploited throughout the simulation time. The preliminary simulation results point out that the adoption of our software agent enhances dramatically the effectiveness of the entire mission, increasing and optimizing in-orbit activities, on the one hand, reducing events\u27 response latency (opportunities, failures, malfunctioning, etc.) on the other.

Besides, an overview of the parameters processed as input and the expected algorithms\u27 output will be provided, to contextualize the placement of the proposed solution.

maximize the utilization of both resources. However, this generates an

Alguns estudos recentes, apresentam bons resultados ao gerarem modelos de predição de refatorações. Além disso, os estudos mostram que refatorações similares são aplicadas em diferentes contextos e podem ser aprendidas. Neste sentido, a maioria dos trabalhos existentes utiliza técnicas de aprendizado de máquina para gerar modelos que predizem se um dado trecho de código deve ser refatorado. Entretanto, essas abordagens possuem limitações. Elas buscam por refatorações específicas e exatamente como aplicadas por desenvolvedores, o que limita que outras refatorações sejam encontradas. Dada a natureza subjetiva da atividade de refatoração de software, a exploração por refatorações com base em outros critérios também é vantajosa. Existem trabalhos na área conhecida como Refatoração de Software Baseada em Busca (SBR) (do inglês, Search Based Software Refactoring), em que algoritmos de busca são utilizados para encontrar refatorações em um grande espaço de busca e visando a melhorar diversos aspectos. Recentemente, trabalhos em SBR começaram a utilizar exemplos de refatorações já aplicadas por desenvolvedores para incorporar aprendizado na busca. Entretanto, essas abordagens são limitadas em termos de generalização dos resultados, uma vez que não geram um modelo que possa ser utilizado para diferentes programas. Desse modo, abordagens existentes de SBR devem ser configuradas e executadas a cada novo programa. Neste contexto, este trabalho visa a incorporar os benefícios encontrados na área de aprendizado de máquina e na área de SBR, apresentando uma abordagem chamada Gorgeous (do inglês, Generation of Refactoring Algorithms through Grammatical Evolution). Gorgeous tem como objetivo gerar algoritmos de refatoração compostos por regras, que quando executados, determinam trechos de código que devem ser refatorados e refatorações a serem aplicadas. Os algoritmos são criados de forma que as refatorações sugeridas sejam similares a refatorações aplicadas na prática e que também melhorem a qualidade do software. Os algoritmos são criados utilizando um processo de aprendizado que primeiro extrai padrões de refatoração de programas agrupando elementos que foram refatorados de maneira similar. Após isso, uma evolução gramatical é executada para gerar algoritmos de refatoração com base nos padrões extraídos. Gorgeous é avaliada utilizando dados de refatoração extraídos de 40 programas Java do repositório GitHub. Como resultado, os algoritmos gerados foram capazes de obter bons resultados para diferentes programas, melhorando em média 60% a qualidade do programa e obtendo 50% de similaridade com refatorações aplicadas na prática. Palavras-chave: Refatoração, Engenharia de Software Baseada em Busca,Agrupamento, Evolução GramaticalAbstract: The refactoring activity addresses the application of a set of transformations in software artifacts to improve their structure while preserving their functionality. Recent studies present promising results generating prediction models for refactoring. Furthermore, they provide evidences that similar refactoring operations are applied in different contexts and they can be learned using Machine Learning (ML). Most works on ML based refactoring generate models to predict if a piece of code should be refactored. Despite the capability of prediction, existing works are limited to learn specific refactoring operations as applied by developers. However, to explore refactoring operations possibilities based on other criteria is also beneficial, mainly by the subjective context of refactoring. In this context, the Search-Based Software Refactoring (SBR) area addresses studies using search algorithms to find refactoring operations in a huge search space, aiming at improving several other aspects. However, existing SBR approaches do not support generalization of results since they do not generate a model as ML studies. In this way, a SBR approach needs to be configured and executed for each program in need of refactoring. In this context, this work introduces a SBR learning approach aiming at taking most advantage of both fields. Gorgeous (Generation of Refactoring Algorithms through Grammatical Evolution) generates refactoring algorithms composed by several rules determining pieces of code that should be refactored and the refactoring types to be used. A refactoring algorithm provides as solution a set of refactoring operations to be applied in a program. In this respect, the algorithm is generated with the goal of increasing similarity of the refactoring operations with the ones applied in practice, and also improving program quality. To do this, a learning process first extracts refactoring patterns from programs by grouping their elements that were refactored in similar ways. After that, a Grammatical Evolution (GE) is executed to generate the algorithms based on the extracted patterns. Gorgeous is evaluated using refactoring data from 40 Java programs of GitHub repository. The refactoring algorithms are capable of obtaining good results to different programs, obtaining around 60% of program quality improvement and 50% of similarity with real refactoring applications.

One promising technique is to build more intelligent compilers.Compilers map high-level programs to lower-level primitives that run on hardware. During this process, compilers perform many complex optimizations to boost the performance of the generated code. These optimizations often require solving NP-Hard problems and dealing with an enormous search space. To overcome these challenges, compilers currently use hand-engineered heuristics that can achieve good but often far-from-optimal performance. Alternatively, software engineers resort to manually writing the optimizations for every section in the code, a burdensome process that requires prior experience and significantly increases the development time.In this thesis, novel approaches for automatically handling complex compiler optimization tasks are explored. End-to-end solutions using deep reinforcement learning and other machine learning algorithms are proposed. These solutions dramatically reduce the search time while capturing the code structure, different instructions, dependencies, and data structures to enable learning a sophisticated model that can better predict the actual performance cost and determine superior compiler optimizations. The proposed techniques can outperform existing state-of-the-art solutions while requiring shorter search time.

Una delle principali cause dell’aumento di gas serra è senza dubbio l’utilizzo dei combustibili fossili, anche nel campo della mobilità. Per questo motivo, negli ultimi decenni, sono state cercate alternative più ecologiche: la tendenza attuale è senza dubbio quella di muoversi in direzione della trazione elettrica, e in special modo a guida autonoma. Il lavoro oggetto di tesi è appunto inquadrato all’interno del progetto europeo AutoDrive, il quale mira alla progettazione di componenti elettronici e architetture di tipo Fail-Operational, ovvero che continuano a eseguire un insieme definito delle loro funzioni anche in presenza di guasti, che permettano l’introduzione della guida autonoma in autoveicoli di tutte le categorie, con l’intento di contribuire a una mobilità più efficiente e sicura. Infatti, dato il crescente numero di implementazioni software e meccatroniche all’interno delle automobili, sono presenti sempre più rischi dovuti a loro possibili guasti, sia sistematici che aleatori, che devono quindi essere tenuti in considerazione al fine della sicurezza funzionale. Poiché quest’ultima venga garantita è necessario introdurre all’interno del sistema, in modo controllato, un qualche tipo di ridondanza che permetta di mascherare o individuare i guasti che si possono verificare.
La possibilità di realizzare veicoli a trazione elettrica è strettamente legata ai progressi conseguiti nel campo delle batterie, specialmente per quanto riguarda le tecnologie basate sugli ioni di Litio. Infatti, quest’ultime presentano una maggiore densità di energia e di potenza, una tensione di cella più elevata, la mancanza di effetto memoria e una minore corrente di auto scarica se confrontate con le altre chimiche esistenti. Grazie a questa serie di vantaggi, le tecnologie basate sugli ioni di Litio, rappresentano l’unico vero candidato per il futuro della mobilità elettrica. Questa tecnologia, tuttavia, presenta degli svantaggi in quanto è necessario l’inserimento di un sistema elettronico che monitori la batteria, il Battery Management System (BMS), il quale ha, tra gli altri, il compito di garantirne il corretto funzionamento in termini di range operativi di tensione, temperatura e corrente. Difatti, la fuoriuscita di queste grandezze dalla loro Safe Operating Area (SOA), oltre a portare un degradamento delle prestazioni della batteria, può provocare l’innescarsi di condizioni ben più gravi quali fughe termiche interne alle celle o persino l’esplosione delle celle stesse. Qualora il BMS identifichi una situazione critica per l’operatività della batteria, questo sistema interviene attraverso un sistema di feedback sul circuito, andando ad esempio a distaccare il carico. Il BMS misura costantemente tutte le grandezze fisiche delle celle che compongono la batteria, quali corrente, tensione e temperatura. A partire da queste, oltre a verificare se i dati sono all’interno della loro SOA, questo sistema esegue degli algoritmi di stima dello stato della batteria andando a ricavare dei parametri tipici quali lo stato di carica (SoC) e lo stato di salute (SoH) e, qualora fosse richiesto, si occupa di loggare e comunicare queste informazioni agli altri blocchi che compongono il sistema.
Nel caso in cui si voglia realizzare un intero sistema avente una batteria agli ioni litio e che presenti un comportamento di tipo Fail-Operational, come quello in esame nel progetto Autodrive, anche il BMS deve avere questa caratteristica. Per questo motivo, partendo dunque dalla struttura convenzionale del BMS, sono state aggiunte strutture ridondanti al fine di raggiungere l’obbiettivo preposto. La ridondanza può essere classificata in due grandi categorie, spaziale e temporale: la prima involve l’introduzione all’interno del sistema di componenti, o funzioni, che sarebbero inutili in ambienti privi di guasti, mentre la seconda è basata sulla ripetizione delle operazioni eseguite e il confronto con il risultato precedente. Specialmente in applicazioni safety-critical, quali quella automotive, la ridondanza di tipo spaziale è necessaria al fine di raggiungere i massimi livelli di sicurezza stabiliti dagli standard, quali ISO 26262.
Per questo motivo la struttura convenzionale del BMS è stata replicata e un’estensione del BMS stesso, che ricopre un ruolo decisionale, è stata sviluppata su una piattaforma FPGA. La scelta di utilizzare un FPGA invece di un microcontrollore, porta numerosi vantaggi, tra i quali un incremento delle capacità computazionali e una maggiore flessibilità e riconfigurabilità del sistema sviluppato. Nel dettaglio è stato scelto di modificare la struttura del BMS andando a sviluppare un sistema in triplice ridondanza nel quale, come suggerisce il nome, si ha una triplicazione parallela del sistema. I tre flussi di dati ottenuti vengono sottoposti a un sistema di voting a maggioranza, dal quale si ottiene un unico flusso di uscita, permettendo dunque di mascherare un guasto su uno dei tre ingressi. A questo scopo sono state sviluppate delle periferiche hardware su FPGA per eseguire le operazioni di voting sui dati e per stimare la regione di lavoro della batteria. È stata inoltre sviluppata una interfaccia grafica su PC, la quale permette di configurare opportunamente le periferiche implementate e mostra in tempo reale tutte le informazioni riguardo alla batteria, tra le quali i valori di tensione delle celle, le temperature e lo stato del sistema. Il sistema è stato infine testato andando a triplicare virtualmente il BMS convenzionale a nostra disposizione e, manipolando i dati su ciascuna linea in modo controllato, è stato verificato il corretto funzionamento delle periferiche sviluppate e validata l’architettura proposta.

The growing awareness about the environmental issues is bringing to the attention the pollution topics, especially the greenhouse gas emission. One of the main causes is fossil fuel consumption for the energy production, even in the automotive systems. For this reason, during the last decades greener alternatives have been sought, and the actual trend is the one that leads to the electrical traction, especially towards the autonomous driving system. The thesis work is part of the European project AutoDrive, which aims at designing Fail-Operational electronic components and system architectures, that enables the introduction of automated driving in all car categories to make future mobility more efficient and safer. It is said that a system presents a Fail-Operational behaviour if it continues to execute a defined set of its function even in presence of faults. Given the increasing number of software and mechatronic implementations within the automotive systems, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures that must be considered within the scope of functional safety. Since this last one must be guaranteed, the introduction within the system of some kind of redundancy is mandatory in order to detect or mask the possible faults.
The possibility of developing electrical traction vehicles is closely related to the progress made in the battery field, especially with regards to the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) based technologies. In fact, these types of cells present a higher energy and power density, an higher cell voltage, no memory effect and a lower auto discharge current compared to the other chemistries. Thanks to these advantages, Li-ion based technologies are the only real candidate for the future electrical mobility. However, this chemistry also brings some disadvantages since a battery monitoring system, the Battery Management System (BMS), is mandatory. This system has to ensure the maintenance of the all cells composing the battery pack within their operative ranges in terms of voltages, temperatures and current. In fact, the coming out of one or more of these measures from its Safe Operating Area (SOA) brings a degradation of the cell’s performance, and could also lead to hazardous conditions, such us thermal runaway within the cell itself or even explosions. If the BMS identifies a critical condition for the battery functionality, it acts on the circuit though a feedback system, for example disconnecting the load. The BMS also uses the acquired measures in order to estimate typical battery parameters, such as State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH), and, if required, it also provides logging functionality and communicates to the other blocks composing the system.
In the case of a system containing a Li-ion battery with Fail-Operational behaviour has to be developed, such as the project AutoDrive one, even the BMS must show this characteristic. For this reason, starting from a conventional BMS, redundant structures have been added to the system in order to reach the responsible goal.
Redundancy can be classified into two main categories: space redundancy and time redundancy. The former involves the introduction within the system of components, or functions, that would be useless in a fault-free environment, while the latter is based on the repetition of the tasks and the comparison of the results to a stored copy of the previous ones. Especially in safety-critical applications, such as automotive, space redundancy is mandatory in order to ensure the safety level required by standards, such as ISO 26262. Therefore, the conventional structure of BMS has been replicated and an extension of BMS itself, which acts as decisional unit, has been developed on a FPGA platform. The FPGA approach, compared to a microcontroller-based one, brings several advantages, such as an increased computational capability and a higher flexibility and reconfigurability of the developed system. More specifically, the conventional structure of the BMS has been modified by using a Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) approach. As the name suggests, TMR involves the triplication of the components to perform the same computation in parallel. The three obtained data flows are then subjected to a majority voting unit, which provides a single data flow as output, allowing to mask a fault in one of the inputs. For this purpose, hardware peripherals within the FPGA fabric have been developed in order to execute voting and operating area estimation algorithms. Furthermore, a PC graphical user interface has been developed and it allows to configure the hardware peripherals and to show real-time information about the battery pack, such as cell voltages, temperatures and current. The system has been finally tested by virtually triplicating the conventional BMS at our disposal and, manipulating each data flow in a controlled manner, the proper functioning of the developed peripherals has been verified and the proposed architecture has been validated",space,242,unknown

Not only the routes planning must be realized before their execution, but also other types of decisions must be taken, in order to answer events that may dynamically occur during operations, as for instance road network congestion or vehicle

failures. Each decision can involve different aspects: for instance, the price negotiation of a just-in-time order should take into consideration the current routes status and planning. Off-the-shelf decision support software, although able to independently support the decision makers in each area, tend to keep tasks compartmentalized.

Trans-Cel, a small trucking company in Padova (Italy), has a Research and Development branch developing a cloud-based platform, called Chainment, able to host different decision support tools that can communicate through a data sharing system. These tools rely on an algorithmic engine that includes a routing optimization algorithm and artificial intelligence systems. In particular, the routing problem combines express couriers requirements, generally studied in urban contexts, with routes and vehicle features typical of medium- and long-haul trips, showing interesting characteristics that are worth of study in the Operation Research field.

In this thesis, we focus on the design of an optimization algorithm able to provide a solution to a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) inspired by the Trans-Cel scenario, that we name Express Pickup and Delivery in freight Trucking problem (EPDT).

The classical VRP definition includes a set of customers and a fleet of vehicles and aims to define a set of routes such that all customers are visited exactly once while minimizing the overall distance traveled. In the scientific literature, the basic definition of the problem has been generalized in order to consider additional attributes, often rising from real-world scenarios, as for instance capacity of vehicles, time windows and orders with both pickup and delivery operations. Often, in real-world cases, decision makers must simultaneously deal with a large number of attributes, thus defining a class of routing problems called Multi-Attribute VRP (MAVRP), which includes EPDT.

The thesis proposes a meta-heuristic algorithm for the solution of EPDT, with the aim of embedding it in the algorithmic engine of Chainment. In order to comply with the platform  requirements, the algorithm is designed so that a solution is returned within few seconds.

The solution method we propose consists of a two-level heuristic: at the first level, a Tabu Search algorithm hybridized with a Variable Neighborhood Descent explores the order-to-vehicle assignments, while, at the second level, it makes use of a Local Search to determine the sequence of customers visited and obtain an evaluation of routes.

The algorithm efficiency is enhanced by the use of a granular exploration, by procedures for fast evaluation of solutions in the neighborhoods, and parallel implementation of specific algorithmic components. These elements are adapted to the specific attributes of EPDT and represent some of the thesis contributions. The improvement in computational times have been validated by the experimental results, verifying the desired requirements for the platform integration.

The quality of the solutions obtained with the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm has been assessed both on the field, by comparison with Trans-Cel operations managers, and through bounds obtained with mathematical programming methods. To this purpose, the thesis proposes an Integer Linear Programming formulation for EPDT and a solution method for its continuous

relaxation based on Column Generation. In particular, the thesis presents new pricing procedures suitable for the specific EPDT attributes. The available bounds show optimality or near-optimality of solutions provided by the heuristic algorithm for real instances. Moreover, the algorithm has been tested on literature benchmarks related to the Pickup and Delivery

Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW), providing solutions that are competitive with the state-of-the-art.

The thesis also proposes a preliminary study of new approaches for vehicle routing problems in dynamic contexts. In particular, the thesis explores the possibility of taking advantage from the availability of historical data on orders by means of anticipatory strategies. The first strategy is based on clustering methods that are applied to the orders to define space-time

points that aggregate the information on future demand. A second strategy is based on the concept of accessibility, as defined in the discrete choice theory and urban logistic, to represent the route capability of intercepting future orders.

The heuristic algorithm proposed for EPDT has been integrated in the algorithmic engine of the Chainment platform at Trans-Cel. The thesis describes integration and the adaptation of the proposed optimization algorithms for a proper interaction with the different modules in the operational context handled by the platform, as, for instance, initial routes planning, reacting to dynamic events or order price negotiation",space,243,unknown

framework for robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD). The latter refers to methodologies
that develop behavioral policies from example state-to-action mappings. To this
end, we study the reciprocal interaction of perception and action, in order to teach robots
a repertoire of novel action behaviors. Based on that, we design, develop and implement
a robust imitation framework, termed IMFO (IMitation Framework by Observation), that
facilitates imitation learning and relevant applications in human-robot interaction (HRI)
tasks. IMFO can cope with the reproduction of learned (i.e. previously observed) actions,
aswell as novel ones. Mapping of human actions to the respective robotic ones is achieved
via an indeterminate depiction, termed latent space representation. The latter accomplishes
a compact, yet precise abstraction of action trajectories, effectively representing
high dimensional raw actions in a low dimensional space.
Moreover, throughout this thesis, we examine the role of time in LfD by enhancing
the aforementioned framework with the notion of learning both the spatial and temporal
characteristics of human motions. Accordingly, learned actions can be subsequently reproduced
in the context of more complex time-informed HRI scenarios. Unlike previous
LfD methods that cope only with the spatial traits of an action, the formulated scheme
effectively encompasses spatial and temporal aspects. Extensive experimentation with a
variety of real robotic platforms demonstrates the robustness and applicability of the introduced
integrated LfD scheme.
Learned actions are reproduced under the high level control of a time-informed task
planner. During the implementation of the studied scenarios, temporal and physical constraints
may impose speed adaptations in the performed actions. The employed latent
space representation readily supports such variations, giving rise to novel actions in the
temporal domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
enhanced imitation scheme in the implementation of HRI scenarios. Additionally, a set
of well defined evaluation metrics are introduced to assess the validity of the proposed
approach considering the temporal and spatial consistency of the reproduced behaviors.
A noteworthy extension of the above regards force-based object grasping for executing
sensitive manipulation tasks. This is also treated in the current thesis via a novel supervised
learning scheme, termed SLF (Supervised Learning for Force-based manipulation).
SLF is formulated as a three-stage process: (a) supervised trial-execution in simulation
to acquire sufficient training data; (b) training to facilitate grasp learning with suitable
robot-arm pose and lifting force; (c) grasp execution in simulation. Subsequently, following
sim-to-real transfer, operation in real environments is achieved in addition to simulated
ones, generalizing also for objects not included in the trial sessions. The proposed
learning scheme is demonstrated in object lifting tasks where the applied force varies for
different objects with similar contact friction coefficients, and likewise the grasping pose.
Experimental results on the manipulator YuMi show that the robot is able to effectively
reproduce demanding lifting and manipulation tasks after learning is accomplished.
In summary, our thesis has studied LfD and has contributed with a novel approach that
introduced latent space representations to encode the action characteristics. A framework
implementation (IMFO) of our approach allowed extensive experimentation and also conduction
of HRI scenarios. The inclusion of temporal aspects in our approach enhanced it
to cope with complex, real-life interactions. Finally, the extension of IMFO with forcebased
grasping facilitated manipulation tasks with sensitive objects",space,244,unknown

This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Our Integrated Software Health Management (ISWHM) system continuously monitors the hardware sensors and the software in real-time. The ISWHM uses Bayesian networks, compiled to arithmetic circuits, to model software and hardware interactions. Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.  As our initial demonstration platform, we use a primitive Lego rover. A Lego 
Mindstorms microcontroller is used to implement a highly simplified autonomous rover driving system, running on the OSEK real-time operating system.

This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique potential as research tools to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures, i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom allow tight and swift direction changes, and turns on the spot. Presented hardware experiments are conducted in an open-loop manner, with little control and computational effort. For more versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be included for feedback control with an open communication protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion. It trots with a cost of transport of 3.2 J/(Nm),at a speed of 0.63 m s(-1) (Froude number 0.25). The robot trots inclined slopes up to 10 degrees, at 0.25 m s(-1).

The navigation agent learns an effective policy over a diverse action space in a large heterogeneous environment consisting of more than 2km of travel, through buildings and outdoor regions that collectively exhibit large variations in visual appearance, self-similarity, and connectivity.

The first group includes the development of a new algorithm and an open-source user-friendly package for optimization over the efficient set for bi-objective mixed integer linear programs.  The second group includes an application of a special case of optimization over the efficient on conservation planning problems modeled with modern portfolio theory. Finally, the third group presents a machine learning framework to enhance criterion space search algorithms for multi-objective binary linear programming.
In the first group of contributions, this thesis presents the first (criterion space search) algorithm for optimizing a linear function over the set of efficient solutions of bi-objective mixed integer linear programs. The proposed algorithm is developed based on the triangle splitting method (Boland et al.), which can find a full representation of the nondominated frontier of any bi-objective mixed integer linear program. The proposed algorithm is easy to understand and implement, and converges quickly to an optimal solution. An extensive computational study shows the efficacy of the algorithm. Is numerically shown in this thesis that the proposed algorithm can be used to quickly generate a provably high-quality approximate solution because it maintains a lower and an upper bound on the optimal value of the linear function at any point in time. Additionally, this thesis presents OOESAlgorithm.jl, a comprehensive julia package based on the proposed algorithm. The proposed package ex- tends the first implementation of the algorithm by adding two main features: (a) in addition to CPLEX, the package allows employing any single-objective solver supported by Math- ProgBase.jl, for example, GLPK, CPLEX, and SCIP; (b) the package supports execution
on multiple processors and is compatible with the JuMP modeling language. An extensive computational study shows the efficacy of the package and its features.
In the  second group of contributions, this thesis presents a Nash bargaining solu- tion approach for spatial conservation planning problems modeled with modern portfolio theory.  The proposed modern portfolio optimization formulation corresponds to a spatial conservation planning problem involving two conflicting objectives: maximizing return and minimizing risk. A Nash bargaining solution approach is presented in this thesis to directly compute a desirable Pareto-optimal (nondominated) solution for the proposed bi-objective optimization formulation in natural resource management problems. Numerical examples in this thesis show that to directly compute a Nash bargaining solution, a Binary Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (BQCQP) can be solved. This thesis also shows that the proposed approach (implementable with commercial  solvers such as CPLEX) can effectively solve the proposed BQCQP for much larger problems than previous approaches published in the ecological literature.  The new approach expands considerably the applicability of such optimization methods to address real spatial conservation planning problems.
In the third group of contributions, this thesis investigates the possibility of improving the performance of multi-objective optimization solution approaches using machine learning techniques. Specifically, this thesis focus on multi-objective binary linear programs and employs one of the most effective and recently developed criterion space search algorithms, the so-called KSA, during our study.  This algorithm computes all nondominated points of a problem with p objectives by searching on a projected criterion space, i.e., a (p − 1)- dimensional criterion space.  This thesis presents an effective and fast learning approach to identify on which projected space the KSA should work, and also presents several generic features that can be used in machine learning techniques for identifying the best-projected space. Finally, a bi-objective optimization-based heuristic for selecting the best subset of the features to overcome the issue of overfitting in learning is presented. Through an extensive computational study, the performance of the proposed learning approach is tested",space,253,not included

These calculations severely restrict a retrieval algorithm's operational capability as it can take several minutes to retrieve the aerosol layer height for a single ground pixel. This paper proposes a forward modelling approach using artificial neural networks to speed up the retrieval algorithm. The forward model outputs are trained into a set of neural network models to completely replace line-by-line calculations in the operational processor. Results comparing the forward model to the neural network alternative show an encouraging outcome with good agreement between the two when they are applied to retrieval scenarios using both synthetic and real measured spectra from TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on board the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-5 Precursor mission. With an enhancement of the computational speed by 3 orders of magnitude, TROPOMI's operational aerosol layer height processor is now able to retrieve aerosol layer heights well within operational capacity.Atmospheric Remote Sensin",space,254,unknown

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multi-neuronal spike pattern detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike latency, which enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and heterosynaptic plasticity, which allows the own regulation of synaptic weights. From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multi-dimensional, temporal, feature space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to experimental data obtained from a motor-inhibitory cognitive task. The results show that out method exhibits similar performance compared with other classification methods, indicating the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, its simplicity and low computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface, personal biometrics authentication, or early detection of diseases.</p",space,255,not included
,to_check,core,New trends on soft computing models in industrial and environmental applications,2013-01-01 00:00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/211485892.pdf,'Elsevier BV',"The twelve papers included in this special issue represent a selection of extended contributions presented at the Sixth International Conference on Soft Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications, held in Salamanca, Spain, 6–8th April, 2011. Papers were selected on the basis of fundamental ideas and concepts rather than the direct usage of well-established techniques. This special issue is then aimed at practitioners, researchers and post-graduate students, who are engaged in developing and applying advanced Soft Computing Models to solving real-world problems in the Industrial and Environmental fields. The papers are organized as follows. In the first contribution, Graña and Gonzalez-Acuña develop a formulation of dendritic classifiers based on lattice kernels and train them using a direct Monte Carlo approach and a Sparse Bayesian Learning. The results of both kinds of training are compared with the Relevance Vector Machines on a collection of benchmark datasets. In the second contribution by Irigoyen and Miñano, the authors present the results of the identification of the relationship in time, between the required exercise (machine resistance) and the heart rate of the patient in medical effort tests, using a NARX neural network model. In the experimental stage, test data have been obtained by exercising with a cyclo-ergometer in two different tests: Power Step Response and Conconi. Carneiro et al. in the third contribution present a biologically inspired method to deal with the problem in which genetic algorithms are used to create possible solutions for a given dispute. The approach presented is able to generate a broad number of diverse solutions that cover virtually the whole search space for a given problem. The results of this work are being applied in a negotiation tool that is part of the UMCourt conflict resolution platform. In the fourth contribution by Donate et al., they propose a novel Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) approach, where a weighted n-fold validation fitness scheme is used to build an ensemble of neural networks, under four different combination methods: mean, median, softmax and rank-based combinations. Several experiments were held, using six real-world time series with different characteristics and from distinct domains. Overall, the proposed approach achieved competitive results when compared with non weighted n-fold EANN ensembles, the simpler 0-fold EANN and also the popular Holt–Winters statistical method. Dan Burdescu et al. in the fifth contribution, present a system used in the medical domain for three distinct tasks: image annotation, semantic based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. An original image segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure was used to perform the segmentation of medical images. Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The annotation and semantic based retrieval task is evaluated for two annotation models: Cross Media Relevance Model and Continuous-space Relevance Model. Semantic based image retrieval is performed using the methods provided by the annotation models. The ontology used by the annotation process was created in an original manner starting from the information content provided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The experiments were made using a database containing colour images retrieved from medical domain using an endoscope and related to digestive diseases. In sixth paper by Pedraza et al., they develop a face recognition system based on soft computing techniques, which complies with privacy-by-design rules and defines a set of principles that context-aware applications (including biometric sensors) should contain to conform to European and US law. This research deals with the necessity to consider legal issues concerning privacy or human rights in the development of biometric identification in ambient intelligence systems. Clearly, context-based services and ambient intelligence (and the most promising research area in Europe, namely ambient assisted living, ALL) call for a major research effort on new identification procedures. The aim of the research by Redel-Macías et al. in paper seven is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem. In the eighth paper, Wu et al. analyse the existence criterion of loop strategies, and then present some corollaries and theorems, by which the loop strategies and chain strategies can be found, also superfluous strategies and inconsistent strategies. It presents a ranking model that indicates the weak node in strategy set and it also introduces a probability-based model which is the basis of evaluation of strategy. Additionally, this research proposes a method to generate offensive strategy, and the statistic results of simulation game prove the validity of the method. Pop et al. in the ninth paper present an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a local–global approach to the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) and a powerful local search procedure. The computational experiments on several benchmarks instances show that the hybrid algorithm is competitive to all of the known heuristics published to date. In the tenth paper Kramer et al. illustrate how methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting, and monitoring techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable, and smart energy grids. The study is based on the application of kernel methods like support vector regression and kernel density estimation as prediction methods. Furthermore, dimension reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of high-dimensional wind time series are applied. The methods are briefly introduced, related work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The experimental parts are based on real wind energy time series data from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Vera et al. in the eleventh contribution present a novel soft computing procedure based on the application of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and identification systems, which makes it possible to optimise the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving both time and financial costs and/or energy. The novel proposed approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. The final contribution, by Sakalauskas and Kriksciuniene, presents a research about financial market efficiency and to recognize major reversal points of long-term trend of stock market index, which could indicate forthcoming crisis or market raise periods. The study suggests a computational model of financial time series analysis, which combines several approaches of soft computing, including information efficiency evaluation methods (Shannon's entropy, Hurst exponent), neural networks and sensitivity analysis. The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behaviour, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index. The performance of neural network model is explored by applying sensitivity analysis and resulted in selecting smoothing parameters of the input variables. The experimental research investigates behaviour of the long-term trend of the three emerging financial markets within NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchange. Introduction of information efficiency measures improve ability of the model to recognize the approaching reversal of long-term trend from temporary market “nervousness” and can be useful for calibrating stock trading strategy.

We also like to thank our peer-reviewers for their timely diligent work and efficient efforts. We are also grateful to the Editor-in-Chief of Neurocomputing Journal, Prof. Tom Heskes, for his continued support for the SOCO series of conferences and for this Special Issue on this prestigious journal.

,to_check,core,A new tracking approach for multipath mitigation based on antenna array,2011-01-01 00:00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/12042846.pdf,,"In Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS), multipaths (MP) are still one of the major error sources. The additional signal replica due to reflection will introduce a bias in conventional Delay Lock Loops (DLL) which will finally cause a strong positioning error. Several techniques, based on Maximum Likelihood estimation (ML), have been developed for multipaths mitigation/estimation such as the Narrow correlator spacing [1] or the Multipath Estimating Delay-Lock-Loop  (MEDLL) [2] algorithm. These techniques try to discriminate the MP from the Line Of Sight Signal (LOSS) on the time and frequency domains and thus, short delay multipaths (<0.1Chips) can not be completely mitigated. Antenna array perform a spatial sampling of the wave front what makes possible the discrimination of the sources on the space domain (azimuth and elevation). As the time-delay domain and space domain can be assumed independent, we can expect to mitigate/estimate very short delay MP by using an antenna array. However, we don't want to increase too much the size, the complexity and the cost of the receivers and thus, we focus our study on small arrays with a small number of antennas: typically a square 2x2 array. Consequently, conventional beamforming (space Fast Fourier Transform) is not directive enough to assure the mitigation of the multipaths, and then this first class of solutions was rejected. In order to improve the resolution, adaptive beamformers have also been tested. However, the LOSS and the MP signal are strongly correlated and thus, classical adaptive algorithms [3] are not able to discriminate the sources. These preliminary studies have shown that the mitigation/estimation of multipaths based on the space domain will exhibit limited performances in presence of close sources. Then, in order to propose robust algorithms, we decided to investigate a space-time-frequency estimation of the sources. Space Alternating Generalized Expectation maximisation (SAGE) algorithm [4], which is a low-complexity generalization of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm, has been considered. The basic concept of the SAGE algorithm is the hidden data space [4]. Instead of estimating the parameters of all impinging waves in parallel in one iteration step as done by the EM algorithm, the SAGE algorithm estimates the parameters of each signal sequentially. Moreover, SAGE algorithm breaks down the multi-dimensional optimization problem into several smaller problems. In [5], it can be seen that SAGE algorithm is efficient for any multipaths configurations (small relative delays, close DOAs) and space-time-frequency approach is clearly outperforming classical time-frequency approaches. Notwithstanding, SAGE algorithm is a post processing algorithm. Thus, it's necessary to memorise in the receiver the incoming signal in order to apply SAGE estimation. For example, if we want to process 10ms of signal with a 10MHz sampling rate, we need to store a matrix of m*105 with m the number of antennas. In such condition, we can understand than SAGE algorithm is hardly implemented in real time. The challenge is then to find a new type of algorithms that reach the efficiency of the SAGE algorithms, but with a reduced complexity in order to enable real time processing.

Furthermore, the implementation should be compatible with conventional GNSS tracking loops (DLL and PLL). To cope with these two constraints, we propose to apply the SAGE algorithm on the post-correlated signal. Indeed, the correlation step can be seen as a compression step and thus, the size of the studied signal is strongly reduced. In such a way, SAGE algorithm is able to provide estimates of the relative delay and Doppler of the received signals with respect to the local replicas. Thus, a post correlation implementation of SAGE can be seen as a discriminator for both the DLL and the PLL",space,257,not included
,to_check,core,Installation of a very broad band borehole seismic station in Ferrara (Emilia),2012-11-21 00:00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41152694.pdf,OGS,"The Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) is the Italian agency devoted to monitor in real time the seismicity on the Italian territory.  The seismicity in Italy is of course variable in time and space, being also very much dependant on local noise conditions. Specifically, monitoring seismicity in an alluvial basin like the Po one is a challenge, due to consistent site effects induced by soft alluvial deposits and bad coupling with the deep bedrock (Steidl et al., 1996). This problem was tackled by INGV first with the Cavola experiment (Bordoni et al., 2007), where a landslide was seismically characterized using a seismic array and also down-hole logging of P- and S-wave travel times at a borehole drilled within the array; later, with an ad hoc project in 2000-2001, with the first installation of a broad band seismic station nearby Ferrara in a borehole of 135 meters depth. Comparison of recordings with a surface seismic station indicated a noise reduction of 2 decades in power spectral density at frequencies larger than 1.0 Hz (Cocco et al., 2001). The instrumentation in Ferrara has been working for several months but after that the seismic station was discontinued due to lack of maintenance manpower.
The Centro di Ricerche Sismologiche (CRS, Seismological Research Center) of the Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS, Italian National Institute for Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics) in Udine (Italy) after the strong earthquake of magnitude M=6.4 occurred in 1976 in the Italian Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, started to operate the Northeastern Italy (NI) Seismic Network: it currently consists of 15 very sensitive broad band and 21 simpler short period seismic stations, all telemetered to and acquired in real time at the OGS-CRS data center in Udine (Fig. 1).
Real time data exchange agreements in place with other Italian, Slovenian, Austrian and Swiss seismological institutes lead to a total number of about 100 seismic stations acquired in real time, which makes the OGS the reference institute for seismic monitoring of Northeastern Italy. Since 2002 OGS-CRS is using the Antelope software suite on several workstations plus a SUN cluster as the main tool for collecting, analyzing, archiving and exchanging seismic data, initially in the framework of the EU Interreg IIIA project “Trans-national seismological networks in the South-Eastern Alps”. SeisComP is also used as a real time data exchange server tool (Bragato et al., 2011).
Among the various Italian institution with which OGS is cooperating for real time monitoring of local seismicity there is the Regione Veneto (Barnaba et al., 2012). The Southern part of the Veneto Region stands on the Po alluvial basin: earthquake localization and characterization is here again affected in this area by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. OGS ha already experience in running a local seismic network in difficult noise conditions making use of borehole installations (Priolo et al., 2012) in the case of the monitoring of a local storage site for the Italian national electricity company ENEL. Following the ML=5.9 earthquake that struck the Emilia region around Ferrara in Northern Italy on May 20, 2012 at 02:03:53 UTC, a cooperation of INGV, OGS, the Comune di Ferrara and the University of Ferrara lead to the reinstallation of the very broad band borehole seismic station in Ferrara. The aim of the OGS intervention was on one hand to extend its real time seismic monitoring capabilities toward South-East (Fig. 1), including Ferrara and its surroundings, and on the other hand to evaluate the seismic  response at the site.
As concerns the superficial geology of the area where the borehole seismic station  has been installed, the outcropping materials are represented by alluvial deposits of different environments, like channel and proximal levee, inter-fluvial, meander and swamps deposits. As  a consequence, the outcropping deposits are everywhere Holocene in age substantially loose or poorly compacted in the first meters-decameters and granulometrically could vary from clay to coarse sand.
Two preliminary reports prepared by the Italian Department of Civil Defense (Dipartimento Nazionale di Protezione Civile) in collaboration with other institutions describe the data  recorded by the national accelerometric network and complemented by additional data recorded by a number of temporary stations (Dolce et al., 2012a; Dolce et al., 2012b). These reports bear witness of strong ground motion values with an acceleration peak of about 0.9 g in the vertical component recorded during the ML=5.8 earthquake of May 29, 2012 by the Mirandola station, located at about 2 km from the epicentre. The analysis of the seismic noise recorded at some stations shows a quite pronounced peak of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) in the frequency range of 0.6 – 0.9 Hz common to all stations. Finally, strong evidence of liquefaction phenomena are reported at several sites (e.g.: S. Carlo, S. Agostino and Mirabello), most of which have been attributed to the occurrence of saturated sandy layer(s) at shallow depth deposited along an abandoned reach of the Reno River (Papathanassiou et al., 2012).

This software combines artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to find steering strategies close to the global optimum without an initial guess. Furthermore, we implement a three rotational degree-of-freedom rigid-body attitude dynamics model to represent the solar sail in space. Two interplanetary transfers to Mars and Neptune are chosen to represent typical future solar sail mission scenarios.

The increased number of specialized websites and modern profiling techniques have all contributed to an explosion of the income of ad brokers from online advertising. The single biggest threat to this growth is however click fraud. Trained botnets and even individuals are hired by click-fraud specialists in order to maximize the revenue of certain users from the ads they publish on  their websites, or to launch an attack between competing businesses. Most academics and consultants who study online advertising estimate that 15% to 35% of ads in pay per click (PPC) online advertising systems are not authentic. In the first two quarters of 2010, US marketers alone spent $5.7 billion on PPC ads, where PPC ads are between 45 and 50 percent of all online ad spending. On average about $1.5 billion is wasted due to click-fraud. These fraudulent clicks are believed to be initiated by users in poor countries, or botnets, who are trained to click on specific ads. For example, according to a 2010 study from Information Warfare Monitor, the operators of Koobface, a program that installed malicious software to participate in click fraud, made over $2 million in just over a year. The process of making such illegitimate clicks to generate revenue is called click-fraud. Search engines claim they filter out most questionable clicks and either not charge for them or reimburse advertisers that have been wrongly billed. However this is a hard task, despite the claims that brokers\u27 efforts are satisfactory. In the simplest scenario, a publisher continuously clicks on the ads displayed on his own website in order to make revenue. In a more complicated scenario. a travel agent may hire a large, globally distributed, botnet to click on its competitor\u27s ads, hence depleting their daily budget. We analyzed those different types of click fraud methods and proposed new methodologies to detect and prevent them real time. While traditional commercial approaches detect only some specific types of click fraud, Collaborative Click Fraud Detection and Prevention (CCFDP) system, an architecture that we have implemented based on the proposed methodologies, can detect and prevents all major types of click fraud. The proposed solution analyzes the detailed user activities on both, the server side and client side collaboratively to better describe the intention of the click. Data fusion techniques are developed to combine evidences from several data mining models and to obtain a better estimation of the quality of the click traffic. Our ideas are experimented through the development of the Collaborative Click Fraud Detection and Prevention (CCFDP) system. Experimental results show that the CCFDP system is better than the existing commercial click fraud solution in three major aspects: 1) detecting more click fraud especially clicks generated by software; 2) providing prevention ability; 3) proposing the concept of click quality score for click quality estimation. In the CCFDP initial version, we analyzed the performances of the click fraud detection and prediction model by using a rule base algorithm, which is similar to most of the existing systems. We have assigned a quality score for each click instead of classifying the click as fraud or genuine, because it is hard to get solid evidence of click fraud just based on the data collected, and it is difficult to determine the real intention of users who make the clicks. Results from initial version revealed that the diversity of CF attack Results from initial version revealed that the diversity of CF attack types makes it hard for a single counter measure to prevent click fraud. Therefore, it is important to be able to combine multiple measures capable of effective protection from click fraud. Therefore, in the CCFDP improved version, we provide the traffic quality score as a combination of evidence from several data mining algorithms. We have tested the system with a data from an actual ad campaign in 2007 and 2008.  We have compared the results with Google Adwords reports for the same campaign. Results show that a higher percentage of click fraud present even with the most popular search engine. The multiple model based CCFDP always estimated less valid traffic compare to Google. Sometimes the difference is as high as 53%. Detection of duplicates, fast and efficient, is one of the most important requirement in any click fraud solution. Usually duplicate detection algorithms run in real time. In order to provide real time results, solution providers should utilize data structures that can be updated in real time. In addition, space requirement to hold data should be minimum. In this dissertation, we also addressed the problem of detecting duplicate clicks in pay-per-click streams. We proposed a simple data structure, Temporal Stateful Bloom Filter (TSBF), an extension to the regular Bloom Filter and Counting Bloom Filter. The bit vector in the Bloom Filter was replaced with a status vector. Duplicate detection results of TSBF method is compared with Buffering, FPBuffering, and CBF methods. False positive rate of TSBF is less than 1% and it does not have false negatives. Space requirement of TSBF is minimal among other solutions. Even though Buffering does not have either false positives or false negatives its space requirement increases exponentially with the size of the stream data size. When the false positive rate of the FPBuffering is set to 1% its false negative rate jumps to around 5%, which will not be tolerated by most of the streaming data applications. We also compared the TSBF results with CBF. TSBF uses only half the space or less than standard CBF with the same false positive probability. One of the biggest successes with CCFDP is the discovery of new mercantile click bot, the Smart ClickBot. We presented a Bayesian approach for detecting the Smart ClickBot type clicks. The system combines evidence extracted from web server sessions to determine the final class of each click. Some of these evidences can be used alone, while some can be used in combination with other features for the click bot detection. During training and testing we also addressed the class imbalance problem. Our best classifier shows recall of 94%. and precision of 89%, with F1 measure calculated as 92%. The high accuracy of our system proves the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Since the Smart ClickBot is a sophisticated click bot that manipulate every possible parameters to go undetected, the techniques that we discussed here can lead to detection of other types of software bots too. Despite the enormous capabilities of modern machine learning and data mining techniques in modeling complicated problems, most of the available click fraud detection systems are rule-based. Click fraud solution providers keep the rules as a secret weapon and bargain with others to prove their superiority. We proposed validation framework to acquire another model of the clicks data that is not rule dependent, a model that learns the inherent statistical regularities of the data. Then the output of both models is compared. Due to the uniqueness of the CCFDP system architecture, it is better than current commercial solution and search engine/ISP solution. The system protects Pay-Per-Click advertisers from click fraud and improves their Return on Investment (ROI). The system can also provide an arbitration system for advertiser and PPC publisher whenever the click fraud argument arises. Advertisers can gain their confidence on PPC advertisement by having a channel to argue the traffic quality with big search engine publishers. The results of this system will booster the internet economy by eliminating the shortcoming of PPC business model. General consumer will gain their confidence on internet business model by reducing fraudulent activities which are numerous in current virtual internet world",space,260,unknown

The development of this software is at a sufficiently advanced stage where it can be used in actual engine tests to provide valuable data on engine operation and health. This activity will continue and, in addition, the OPAD system is planned to be used in flight aboard space vehicles. The two implementations, test-stand and in-flight, may have some differing requirements. For example, the data stored during a test-stand experiment are much more extensive than in the in-flight case. In both cases though, the majority of the requirements are similar. New data from the spectrograph is generated at a rate of once every 0.5 sec or faster. All processing must be completed within this period of time to maintain real-time performance. Every 0.5 sec, the OPAD system must report the amounts of specific metals within the engine plume, given the spectral data. At present, the software in the OPAD system performs this function by solving the inverse problem. It uses powerful physics-based computational models (the SPECTRA code), which receive amounts of metals as inputs to produce the spectral data that would have been observed, had the same metal amounts been present in the engine plume. During the experiment, for every spectrum that is observed, an initial approximation is performed using neural networks to establish an initial metal composition which approximates as accurately as possible the real one. Then, using optimization techniques, the SPECTRA code is repetitively used to produce a fit to the data, by adjusting the metal input amounts until the produced spectrum matches the observed one to within a given level of tolerance. This iterative solution to the original problem of determining the metal composition in the plume requires a relatively long period of time to execute the software in a modern single-processor workstation, and therefore real-time operation is currently not possible. A different number of iterations may be required to perform spectral data fitting per spectral sample. Yet, the OPAD system must be designed to maintain real-time performance in all cases. Although faster single-processor workstations are available for execution of the fitting and SPECTRA software, this option is unattractive due to the excessive cost associated with very fast workstations and also due to the fact that such hardware is not easily expandable to accommodate future versions of the software which may require more processing power. Initial research has already demonstrated that the OPAD software can take advantage of a parallel computer architecture to achieve the necessary speedup. Current work has improved the software by converting it into a form which is easily parallelizable. Timing experiments have been performed to establish the computational complexity and execution speed of major components of the software. This work provides the foundation of future work which will create a fully parallel version of the software executing in a shared-memory multiprocessor system",space,263,unknown

We have shown how a demo package for RESSAP using MPI can be done. However, we also mentioned the difficulties with the UNIX platform. We have reiterated some of the suggestions made during the presentation of the progress of the at Fourth Annual HBCU Conference. Although we have discussed, in some detail, how TURBDES/PUMPDES software can be run in parallel using MPI, at present, we are unable to experiment any further with either MPI or PVM. Due to X windows not being implemented, we are also not able to experiment further with XPVM, which it will be recalled, has a nice GUI interface. There are also some concerns, on our part, about MPI being an appropriate tool. The best thing about MPr is that it is public domain. Although and plenty of documentation exists for the intricacies of using MPI, little information is available on its actual implementations. Other than very typical, somewhat contrived examples, such as Jacobi algorithm for solving Laplace's equation, there are few examples which can readily be applied to real situations, such as in our case. In effect, the review of literature on both MPI and PVM, and there is a lot, indicate something similar to the enormous effort which was spent on LISP and LISP-like languages as tools for artificial intelligence research. During the development of a book on programming languages [12], when we searched the literature for very simple examples like taking averages, reading and writing records, multiplying matrices, etc., we could hardly find a any! Yet, so much was said and done on that topic in academic circles. It appears that we faced the same problem with MPI, where despite significant documentation, we could not find even a simple example which supports course-grain parallelism involving only a few processes. From the foregoing, it appears that a new direction may be required for more productive research during the extension period (10/19/98 - 10/18/99). At the least, the research would need to be done on Windows 95/Windows NT based platforms. Moreover, with the acquisition of Lahey Fortran package for PC platform, and the existing Borland C + + 5. 0, we can do work on C + + wrapper issues. We have carefully studied the blueprint for Space Transportation Propulsion Integrated Design Environment for the next 25 years [13] and found the inclusion of HBCUs in that effort encouraging. Especially in the long period for which a map is provided, there is no doubt that HBCUs will grow and become better equipped to do meaningful research. In the shorter period, as was suggested in our presentation at the HBCU conference, some key decisions regarding the aging Fortran based software for rocket propellants will need to be made. One important issue is whether or not object oriented languages such as C + + or Java should be used for distributed computing.

This report focused primarily on performance related to the collective outcomes of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs), but additionally explored various descriptive dimensions and acquisition approaches of the same (Kendall, 2013). Each annual report builds on the work previously conducted, and focuses on data-driven analysis relying on statistical techniques to identify trends that improve the defense acquisition communityﾒs insights into how contract incentives are motivating better contractor/vendor performance (Kendal, 2016). Nevertheless, large amounts of data (in modern jargon, ﾓBig Dataﾔ) are now available for research in the area of defense acquisition. Over the past several years, changes in electronic commerce have increased the amounts of both structured and unstructured data availableﾗboth in runtime and archived environments. This electronic data, from a variety of different acquisition agencies, can be obtained by a variety of means and used for a multitude of purposes (Snider et al., 2014). Traditional statistical and trend analysis methods thus far have been primarily relied upon to explore trends and test metrics in the sets of acquisition data at hand. Sometimes, spreadsheets of linear regression correlation are employed, or, in some more modern applications, multivariate structural equation models via scientific applications such as SPSS and AMOS are leveraged for their ability to evaluate complex variable relationships, such as nested or recursive if-then patterns (Byrne, 2016). However, not only are todayﾒs modern datasets large in magnitude, they are also large in variety and complexity (Gartner, 2013). Furthermore, to address this state of data, new statistical modeling techniques, more powerful than before, have had to be created. This is due to the older methods finding difficulty with some of the size problems Big Data represents, such as privacy and security concerns (Parms, 2017). Thankfully, computer power necessary to employ the modern techniques is less expensive today, the software near free, and the storage capacities available now yield bewildering capacities at a fingertip, and with amazingly fast access speed. In fact, these performance parameters appear to continue along a Mooreﾒs trend line against critical opposition (Magee, Basnet, Funk, & Benson, 2015). Presently, one of the more interesting of the new statistical modeling techniques is neural network algorithm machine learning. Neural network modeling involves utilizing a ﾓpowerful computational data model that is able to capture and represent input/output relationships.ﾔ This model was developed out of the desire to create artificial intelligence systems capable of completing functions that were previously executed solely by the human brain. One benefit of using neural network modeling lies with its capacity to display and comprehend both linear and non-linear relationships from the data to which it is supplied (NeuroSolutions, 2015). Research Question Because ﾓBig Dataﾔ is present in the Defense Acquisition Business space, and, because the demand to critically understand real cause-and-effect relationships between variables within that data is persistent from the Acquisition community, this paperﾒs research question is, Can a neural network modeling technique be confidently relied upon to meaningfully explore variable relationships within acquisition business datasets? Because, if it is, then any question may be reasonably asked by anyone of such a dataset; and, via the neural network-enabled tool, the answers they receive will come with scientific statistical confidence as to whether they can be trusted as interesting or useful answers.1 In order to explore this research question, the study opted to use business data on contractor performance and attempted to isolate predictive variables from past performance information predictive of good performance.Naval Postgraduate School Acquisition Research Progra",e-commerce,268,unknown
,to_check,core,,2004-07-06 00:00:00,core,"autonomous agents in bargaining games: an evolutionary investigation of fundamentals, strategies, and business applications",,"Bargaining is becoming increasingly important due to developments within the field of electronic commerce, especially the development of autonomous software agents. Software agents are programs which, given instructions from a user, are capable of autonomously and intelligently realise a given task. By means of such agents, the bargaining process can be automated, allowing products and services together with related conditions, such as warranty and delivery time, to be flexible and tuned to the individual preferences of the people concerned. In this theses we concentrate on both fundamental aspects of bargaining as well as business-related applications of automated bargaining using software agents. The fundamental part investigates bargaining outcomes within a stylised world, and the factors that influence these outcomes. This can provide insights for the production of software agents, strategies, and setting up bargaining rules for practical situations. We study these aspects using computational simulations of bargaining agents. Hereby we consider adaptive systems, i.e., where agents learn to adjust their bargaining strategy given past experience. This learning behaviour is simulated using evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms originate from the field of artificial intelligence, and are inspired by the biological theory of evolution. Originally, evolutionary algorithms were designed for solving optimisation problems, but they are now increasingly being used within economics for modelling human learning behaviour. Besides computational simulations, we also consider mathematical solutions from game theory for relatively simple cases. Game theory is mainly concerned with the “rational man”, that is, with optimal outcomes within an stylised setting (or game) where people act rationally. We use the game-theoretic outcomes to validate the computational experiments. The advantage of computer simulations is that less strict assumptions are necessary, and that more complex interactions that are closer to real-world settings can be investigated. First of all, we study a bargaining setting where two players exchange offers and counter offers, the so-called alternating-offers game. This game is frequently used for modelling bargaining about for instance the price of a product or service. It is also important, however, to allow other product- and service-related aspects to be negotiated, such as quality, delivery time, and warranty. This enables compromises by conceding on less important issues and demanding a higher value for relatively important aspects. This way, bargaining is less competitive and the resulting outcome can be mutually beneficial. Therefore, we investigate using computational simulations an extended version of the alternating-offers game, where multiple aspects are negotiated concurrently. Moreover, we apply game theory to validate the results of the computational experiments. The simulation shows that learning agents are capable of quickly finding optimal compromises, also called Pareto-efficient outcomes. In addition, we study the effects of time pressure that arise if negotiations are broken off with a small probability, for example due to external eventualities. In absence of time pressure and a maximum number of negotiation rounds, outcomes are very unbalanced: the player that has the opportunity to make a final offer proposes a take-it-or-leave-it offer in the last round, which leaves the other player with a deal that is only slightly better than no deal at all. With relatively high time pressure, on the other hand, the first offer is most important and almost all agreements are reached in the first round. Another interesting result is that the simulation outcomes after a long period of learning in general coincide with the results from game theory, in spite of the fact that the learning agents are not “rational”. In reality, not only the final outcome is important, but also other factors play a role, such as the fairness of an offer. Using the simulation we study the influence of such fairness norms on the bargaining outcomes. The fairness norms result in much more balanced outcomes, even with no time pressure, and seem to be closer outcomes in the real world. Negotiations are rarely isolated, but can also be influenced by external factors such as additional bargaining opportunities. We therefore also consider bargaining within a market-like setting, where both buyers and sellers can bargain with several opponents before reaching an agreement. The negotiations are executed consecutively until an agreement is reached or no more opportunities are available. Each bargaining game is reduced to a single round, where player 1 makes an offer and player 2 can only respond by rejecting or accepting this offer. Using an evolutionary simulation we study several properties of this market game. It appears that the outcomes depend on the information that is available to the players. If players are informed about the bargaining opportunities of their opponents, the first player in turn has the advantage and always proposes a take-it-or-leave-it deal that leaves the other player with a relatively poor outcome. This outcome is consistent with a game-theoretic analysis which we also present in this thesis. If this information is not available, a theoretical analysis is very hard. The evolutionary simulation, however, shows that in this case the responder obtains a better deal. This occurs because the first player can no longer anticipate the response of the other player, and therefore bids lower to avoid a disagreement. In this thesis, we additionally consider other factors that influence the outcomes of the market game, such as negotiation over multiple issues simultaneously, search costs, and break off probabilities. Besides fundamental issues, this thesis presents a number of business-related applications of automated bargaining, as well as generic bargaining strategies for agents that can be employed in related areas. As a first application, we introduce a framework where negotiation is used for recommending shops to customers, for example on a web page of an electronic shopping mall. Through a market-driven auction a relevant selection of shops is determined in a distributed fashion. This is achieved by selling a limited number of banner spaces in an electronic auction. For each arriving customer on the web page, shops can automatically place bids for this “customer attention space” through their shop agents. These software agents bid based on a customer profile, containing personal data of the customer, such as age, interests, and/or keywords in a search query. The shop agents are adaptive and learn, given feedback from the customers, which profiles to target and how much to bid in the auction. The highest bidders are then selected and displayed to the customer. The feasibility of this distributed approach for matching shops to customers is demonstrated using an evolutionary simulation. Several customer models and auction mechanisms are studied, and we show that the market-based approach results in a proper selection of shops for the customers. Bargaining can be especially beneficial if not only the price, but other aspects are considered as well. This allows for example to customise products and services to the personal preferences of a user. We developed a system makes use of these properties for selling and personalising so-called information goods, such as news articles, software, and music. Using the alternating-offers protocol, a seller agent negotiates with several buyers simultaneously about a fixed price, a per-item price, and the quality of a bundle of information goods. The system is capable of taking into account important business-related conditions such as the fairness of the negotiation. The agents combine a search strategy and a concession strategy to generate offers in the negotiations. The concession strategy determines the amount the agent will concede each round, whereas the search strategy takes care of the personalisation of the offer. We introduce two search strategies in this thesis, and show through computer experiments that the use of these strategies by a buyer and seller agent, result in personalised outcomes, also when combined with various concession strategies. The search strategies presented here can be easily applied to other domains where personalisation is important. In addition, we also developed concession strategies for the seller agent that can be used in settings where a single seller agent bargains with several buyer agents simultaneously. Even if bargaining itself is bilateral (i.e., between two parties), a seller agent can actually benefit from the fact that several such negotiations occur concurrently. The developed strategies are focussed on domains where supply is flexible and can be adjusted to meet demand, like for information goods. We study fixed strategies, time-dependent strategies and introduce several auction-inspired strategies. Auctions are often used when one party negotiates with several opponents simultaneously. Although the latter strategies benefit from the advantages of auctions, the actual negotiation remains bilateral and consists of exchanging offers and counter offers. We developed an evolutionary simulation environment to evaluate the seller agent’s strategies. We especially consider the case where buyers are time-impatient and under pressure to reach agreements early. The simulations show that the auction-inspired strategies are able to obtain almost maximum profits from the negotiations, given sufficient time pressure of the buyers",e-commerce,270,unknown

This paper targets multi-agent systems that employ rulebased logics (i.e., rules that determine the output/response of an agent depending on the range of the input values) with pre-defined rules to accurately perceive the environment, and provide associated reactions. Such rule-based systems do not perform well in scenarios, where human generated rules cannot adapt to dynamic variations in the data distribution arising due to dynamic changes in the environment, especially if data dimensionality is very high. Examples of such scenarios exist wherever the sensed data arrives from the physical world - such as weather data, physical sensor data, human behaviour controlled data, etc. Clearly, to meet the adaptivity requirements of such scenarios we require the agents to possess adaptive reasoning capability such that they can adapt the underlying rules with respect to the changing environment. Developing such adaptive agents requires the developer to additionally possess considerable expertise of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, apart from possessing knowledge of the agent's target domain. To address the above issues, we automate the process of development and deployment of adaptive agents.

SynAdapt provides the following key features: a) Automated synthesis and deployment of adaptive agents from high-level user specification, b) Agents synthesised by SynAdapt can select a learning strategy that is particularly suited for given user specifications and input dataset, and c) Agents synthesised by SynAdapt can leverage adaptive ensemble learning techniques to deal with concept drift.",space,276,unknown

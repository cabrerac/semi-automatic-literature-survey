# Semantic filters uses LLMs to match abstracts with the provided description.
# The type parameter corresponds to the embedding the semantic search uses. Bert is the open option it currently uses.
# The description parameter is the text that describes the papers you are looking for. A way to create such description is to think of the ideal abstract a selected paper should have.
# The score parameter is the similarity degree between the queries and the included papers.
# Papers with greater or equal score are included.

  - description: "The public sector has a strong interest in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, many public agencies lack the tools and frameworks to guide the design of AI-based systems aimed at creating public value. Architectures and frameworks offer a foundation for designing coherent AI-based systems. This paper reports on the design and evaluation of an AI-based system architecture for public value creation. The architecture comprises distinct and interrelated architectural layers. The architecture offers guidance on innovative models for public agencies to create and capture AI-enabled public value. The architecture presents a validated tool to guide the implementation of AI in public agencies, while creating public value and mitigating potential societal harms."

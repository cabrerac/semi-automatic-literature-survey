# Some APIs do not provide the functionality to filter by more specific keywords in the abstract. The syntactic filters
# are keywords that must appear in the abstract of the papers to review. One filter can be composed by multiple
# keywords in conjunction. Synonyms are also used for each keyword in disjunction. If you do not want to use syntactic
# filters comment the whole block.
syntactic_filters:
  - machine learning
  - real-world
  - deploy
# Semantic filters are used to classify the papers and decide which ones to exclude according to their abstract content
# The papers that belong to the excluded classes are removed. The semantic filter uses the lbl2vec algorithm described
# here: https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-text-classification-with-lbl2vec-6c5e040354de.
# If you do not want to use semantic filters please comment the whole block.

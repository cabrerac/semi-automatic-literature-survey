# SaLS Basic Search Configuration Template
# =============================================================================
# This template provides a minimal configuration for basic literature searches
# Copy this file and modify the values according to your research needs
# =============================================================================

# REQUIRED: Search queries in the format <query_name>: "<query_value>"
# Supported operators: & (AND), | (OR), and parentheses for grouping
# Use quotes around multi-word terms: 'machine learning' & 'edge computing'
queries:
  - machine learning: "'machine learning' & 'edge computing'"
  - artificial intelligence: "'artificial intelligence' | 'AI'"

# OPTIONAL: Synonyms to expand your search queries
# These will be automatically added to your searches to increase coverage
machine learning:
  - ml
  - deep learning
  - neural networks
  - supervised learning
  - unsupervised learning

artificial intelligence:
  - ai
  - machine intelligence
  - cognitive computing

# REQUIRED: Databases to search for papers
# Open databases (no API key required): arxiv, semantic_scholar
# Commercial databases (API key required): springer, ieeexplore, scopus, core
# See README.md for API key setup instructions
databases:
  - arxiv                    # Open access, no API key needed
  - semantic_scholar        # Open access, no API key needed
  # - springer               # Uncomment and add API key to config.json
  # - ieeexplore            # Uncomment and add API key to config.json
  # - scopus                # Uncomment and add API key to config.json
  # - core                  # Uncomment and add API key to config.json

# OPTIONAL: Date range for your search (YYYY-MM-DD format)
# Comment out both lines to search all available papers
# Including dates can significantly reduce search time and improve relevance
# start_date: 2020-01-01    # Papers published from this date
# end_date: 2024-12-31      # Papers published until this date

# REQUIRED: Search metadata
search_date: 2024-12-15     # Date when this search was performed
folder_name: basic_search    # Output folder name (will be created automatically)

# =============================================================================
# ADVANCED FEATURES (Optional - uncomment and configure as needed)
# =============================================================================

# OPTIONAL: Syntactic filters for more precise control
# These terms will be required in the paper content
# syntactic_filters:
#   - edge computing
#   - distributed systems

# OPTIONAL: Semantic filters using AI-powered similarity matching
# Format: filter_name: "detailed description of what you're looking for"
# semantic_filters:
#   - edge computing: "Papers about edge computing, fog computing, and distributed edge systems"
#   - machine learning: "Research on machine learning algorithms and applications in edge environments"

# =============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES
# =============================================================================
# 1. Start with simple queries and refine based on results
# 2. Use specific terms rather than broad concepts
# 3. Include synonyms to catch related research
# 4. Set reasonable date ranges to focus on recent work
# 5. Test with open databases first before adding commercial ones
# 6. Use semantic filters for complex research areas

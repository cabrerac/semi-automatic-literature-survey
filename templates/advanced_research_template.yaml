# REQUIRED: Database selection for comprehensive coverage
# Mix open and commercial databases for best results
# Open databases: arxiv, semantic_scholar (no API key needed)
# Commercial databases: springer, ieeexplore, scopus, core (API key required)
databases:
  - arxiv                    # Open access, excellent for recent research
  - semantic_scholar        # Open access, good citation analysis
  - springer                # Commercial, high-quality journals
  - ieeexplore              # Commercial, excellent for engineering
  - scopus                  # Commercial, comprehensive coverage
  - core                    # Commercial, open access repository
  # Additional databases available: crossref, europe_pmc, pubmed, openalex

# OPTIONAL: Date range for focused research (YYYY-MM-DD format)
# Use date ranges to focus on recent developments or specific time periods
# Comment out both lines to search all available papers
start_date: 2018-01-01      # Focus on recent research (last 6 years)
end_date: 2024-12-31        # Include current year

# REQUIRED: Search metadata
search_date: 2024-12-15     # Date when this search was performed
folder_name: advanced_research  # Output folder name (will be created automatically)

# OPTIONAL: Syntactic filters for precise control
# These terms must appear in the paper content
# Use for filtering out irrelevant papers early in the process
syntactic_filters:
  - systems
  - engineering
  - architecture
  - design
  - implementation
  - evaluation
  - analysis

# OPTIONAL: Semantic filters using AI-powered similarity matching
# These use BERT-based models to find semantically similar papers
# Format: filter_name: "detailed description of what you're looking for"
# Be specific and descriptive for best results
semantic_filters:
  - systems engineering: "Research on systems engineering methodologies, frameworks, and approaches applied to complex systems, including requirements engineering, system architecture, design patterns, and lifecycle management"
  
  - edge orchestration: "Papers about orchestration, composition, and choreography of edge computing resources and services, including placement strategies, resource allocation, and workload distribution in edge environments"
  
  - production ml: "Research on machine learning systems in production environments, including MLOps, deployment strategies, monitoring, scaling, and operational challenges of ML systems"

# =============================================================================
# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# =============================================================================

# OPTIONAL: Custom fields and types (advanced users)
# fields: ['title', 'abstract', 'keywords', 'full_text']
# types: ['conferences', 'journals', 'preprints', 'reports']

# OPTIONAL: Custom search parameters (advanced users)
# max_papers_per_database: 1000
# search_timeout: 300
# retry_attempts: 3

# =============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES FOR ADVANCED RESEARCH
# =============================================================================
# 1. QUERIES: Start broad, then narrow down based on initial results
# 2. SYNONYMS: Include variations, abbreviations, and related terminology
# 3. DATABASES: Use a mix of open and commercial for comprehensive coverage
# 4. DATES: Set reasonable ranges to focus on relevant time periods
# 5. FILTERS: Use syntactic filters for precision, semantic filters for recall
# 6. ITERATION: Run multiple searches with refined parameters
# 7. VALIDATION: Check results manually to ensure quality
# 8. DOCUMENTATION: Keep track of search parameters and results
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
# =============================================================================
# - If you get too many results: Add more specific terms or use date ranges
# - If you get too few results: Broaden queries or add synonyms
# - If semantic filtering fails: Check that descriptions are detailed and specific
# - If API errors occur: Verify API keys in config.json or use open databases
# - If validation fails: Check YAML syntax and required field formats

# =============================================================================
# ML-SPECIFIC BEST PRACTICES
# =============================================================================
# 1. QUERIES: Use specific ML terminology (e.g., 'CNN' not just 'neural networks')
# 2. SYNONYMS: Include abbreviations and alternative names commonly used in ML
# 3. DATES: ML field evolves rapidly - focus on recent years for cutting-edge research
# 4. FILTERS: Use ML-specific terms to filter out non-ML papers
# 5. ITERATION: ML research has many subfields - refine queries based on results
# 6. VALIDATION: Check that results are actually ML research, not just mentions
# 7. COVERAGE: ML papers appear in many venues - use multiple databases
# 8. TERMINOLOGY: Stay current with ML terminology and naming conventions
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# ML RESEARCH SUBFIELDS TO CONSIDER
# =============================================================================
# - Supervised Learning: classification, regression, structured prediction
# - Unsupervised Learning: clustering, dimensionality reduction, generative models
# - Reinforcement Learning: Q-learning, policy methods, multi-agent systems
# - Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs, transformers, attention mechanisms

# =============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING FOR ML RESEARCH
# =============================================================================
# - Too many results: Add specific ML subfield terms or application domains
# - Too few results: Broaden ML terminology or remove overly specific filters
# - Irrelevant results: Use more specific ML terms and syntactic filters
# - Missing recent papers: Check date ranges and ensure recent databases are included
# - API errors: Use open databases (arxiv, semantic_scholar) if commercial ones fail
